Implement anti-debugging checks in iOS apps that handle high-risk flows, and run those checks at startup and before or during sensitive operations instead of relying on a single startup check.

Use anti-debugging as a defense-in-depth control. A local attacker who controls the device or app package can eventually bypass client-side checks through patching, instrumentation, or a modified runtime. The goal is to raise attacker effort, make bypasses harder to maintain, and feed risk signals into broader app and backend policy.

## Use Layered Signals

Combine multiple signal types from @MASTG-KNOW-0085 instead of depending on one API. For example:

- Use [`ptrace`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/ptrace.2.html "PTRACE(2)") and `PT_DENY_ATTACH` where this is acceptable for the app's distribution model.
- Use process-state checks such as Apple's archived [`sysctl` debugger detection example](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1361/_index.html "Detecting the Debugger") as one reactive signal.
- Add parent-process or Mach exception port checks where they fit the app's threat model.

Validate the implementation against the app's distribution requirements. Some low-level APIs used by anti-debugging implementations aren't part of the public iOS SDK, and apps distributed through the App Store must comply with Apple's public API and review requirements.

## Check Sensitive Flows

Run anti-debugging checks close to security-relevant operations, such as:

- key unwrapping or signing
- payment approval
- authentication or step-up authorization
- secrets access
- premium feature enforcement
- high-risk transaction submission

Avoid tight polling loops that waste battery or degrade performance. Prefer checkpoint-based checks before sensitive actions, with short periodic checks only while sensitive flows are active.

## Harden the Check and Response

Obfuscate anti-debugging logic and avoid centralizing every check behind a single named function. A single dispatch point is easier to hook or patch than several distributed checks.

When the app detects a debugger, use a response that fits the risk of the protected flow. For example, terminate the sensitive operation, clear transient secrets from memory, require reauthentication, reduce functionality, or send a generic risk signal to the backend. Avoid exposing detailed detection reasons to the client because they help attackers tune bypasses.

Test the checks in release builds. Debug-only code paths, checks that run only once at startup, or responses that can be bypassed by hooking one function provide limited resilience.

The `ContentProvider` enables Android applications to share data with other applications and system components. If a `ContentProvider` constructs SQL queries using untrusted input from URIs, IPC calls, or Intents without validation or parameterization, it becomes vulnerable to SQL injection. Attackers can take advantage of this vulnerability to bypass access controls and extract sensitive data. Improper handling of URI path segments, query parameters, or `selection` arguments in `ContentProvider` queries can lead to arbitrary SQL execution.

- **Use Parameterized Queries**: Instead of building SQL using string concatenation, use `selection` and `selectionArgs` parameters.

For example:

```kotlin
  val idSegment = uri.getPathSegments()[1]
  val selection = "id = ?"
  val selectionArgs = arrayOf(idSegment)
  val cursor = qb.query(db, projection, selection, selectionArgs, null, null, sortOrder)
```

- **Use Prepared Statements**: When performing insert, update, or delete operations, use SQLite prepared statements (for example, `SQLiteStatement` or `SQLiteDatabase` methods that support argument binding) instead of dynamically constructed SQL. Prepared statements ensure that untrusted input is bound as parameters and can't alter the structure of the SQL query, effectively preventing SQL injection even when input originates from URIs or IPC calls.

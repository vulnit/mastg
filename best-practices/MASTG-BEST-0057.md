All data received from external sources (such as `Intent` extras, activity results, or `ContentProvider` results) must be treated as untrusted and thoroughly sanitized before use. Failure to validate this data can lead to serious vulnerabilities, including arbitrary file access and path traversal. Specifically, applications must always validate URIs and associated metadata before reading from them, copying their content, or passing them to sensitive system APIs.

## Validate the URI scheme

Prefer `content://` URIs over `file://` URIs when processing externally supplied data. A `content://` URI routes access through a `ContentProvider` when opened with [`ContentResolver.openInputStream`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentResolver#openInputStream(android.net.Uri)), allowing provider-level access controls and URI grants to apply. A `file://` URI is resolved directly as a filesystem path using the calling app's own process identity and permissions. This means a malicious responding app can return a `file://` URI pointing at any path the calling app can access, which, depending on the permissions the app holds, may go well beyond its own private storage. See @MASTG-KNOW-0138 for details on URI schemes in intent results.

## Sanitize Filenames Provided by External Components

When querying a `ContentProvider` for [`OpenableColumns.DISPLAY_NAME`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/OpenableColumns#DISPLAY_NAME), sanitize the result before using it as a file name. A malicious provider can return a path-traversal sequence (such as `../lib/native.so`) that redirects writes outside the intended directory. Use [`File.getName`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/io/File#getName()) via `File(name).name` to strip any directory components:

```kotlin
fun sanitizeFileName(name: String): String {
    return File(name).name  // returns only the final path component
}

val rawName = getFileNameFromUri(uri) ?: "default.bin"
val safeName = sanitizeFileName(rawName)
```

## Sanitize Externally Provided Paths Before File Operations

Avoid using paths or filenames received from an intent to construct an output location directly. A malicious responder could supply an absolute path (such as `/sdcard/evil.apk`) that writes to an unintended location. Always anchor the output to a directory you control, such as `filesDir` or `cacheDir`, and append only a sanitized file name:

```kotlin
// Avoid: output path comes from intent data
val output = File(fileNameFromIntent)

// Prefer: fixed base dir with a sanitized filename
val output = File(context.filesDir, sanitizeFileName(fileNameFromIntent))
```

When exposing app-owned files to other apps, prefer [`FileProvider`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/content/FileProvider) with narrow path mappings and temporary URI grants instead of sharing raw filesystem paths.

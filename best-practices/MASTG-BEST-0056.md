Use [explicit intents](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters#ExplicitIntent) when communicating between components within the same app. An explicit intent specifies the target component directly by package name or class name, ensuring the intent can only be delivered to the intended recipient and can't be intercepted by a third-party app through normal intent resolution.

## Java/Kotlin

Set the target package with [`Intent.setPackage`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#setPackage(java.lang.String)) or target a specific component before sending the intent:

```kotlin
// Explicit by package - restricts delivery to your own app
val intent = Intent("com.example.app.PROCESS_DATA").apply {
    setPackage("com.example.app")
    putExtra("key", "value")
}
startActivity(intent)

// Explicit by component - the most restrictive form
val intent = Intent(context, TargetActivity::class.java).apply {
    putExtra("key", "value")
}
startActivity(intent)
```

Never send sensitive data (tokens, credentials, API keys) in an implicit intent. Android resolves implicit intents by matching installed apps that declare compatible [`<intent-filter>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element) elements, so any matching app can become the selected recipient and receive the intent extras.

## Manifest Configuration

For internal components, ensure they aren't inadvertently exposed to other applications. For detailed instructions on properly securing the `AndroidManifest.xml`, refer to @MASTG-BEST-0052.

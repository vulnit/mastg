title: Binary Patching

Patching is the process of changing the compiled app, e.g., changing code in binary executables, modifying Java bytecode, or tampering with resources. This process is known as _modding_ in the mobile game hacking scene. Patches can be applied in many ways, including editing binary files in a hex editor and decompiling, editing, and re-assembling an app.

Keep in mind that modern mobile operating systems strictly enforce code signing, so running modified apps isn't as straightforward as it used to be in desktop environments. Security experts had a much easier life in the 90s! Fortunately, patching isn't very difficult if you work on your own device. You simply have to re-sign the app or disable the default code signature verification facilities to run modified code.

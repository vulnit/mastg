_Deep links_ are URIs of any scheme that take users directly to specific content in an app. An app can [set up deep links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking) by adding _intent filters_ on the Android Manifest and extracting data from incoming intents to navigate users to the correct activity.

For a large-scale analysis of how Android apps implement and handle deep links, see the research paper ["Measuring the Insecurity of Mobile Deep Links of Android"](https://people.cs.vt.edu/gangwang/deep17.pdf).

Android supports two types of deep links:

- **Custom URL Schemes**, which are deep links that use any custom URL scheme, e.g. `myapp://` (not verified by the OS).
- **Android App Links** (Android 6.0 (API level 23) and higher), which are deep links that use the `http://` and `https://` schemes and contain the `autoVerify` attribute (which triggers OS verification).

**Deep Link Collision:**

Using unverified deep links can cause a significant issue- any other apps installed on a user's device can declare and try to handle the same intent, which is known as **deep link collision**. Any arbitrary application can declare control over the exact same deep link belonging to another application.

In recent versions of Android this results in a so-called _disambiguation dialog_ shown to the user that asks them to select the application that should handle the deep link. The user could make the mistake of choosing a malicious application instead of the legitimate one.

**Android App Links:**

In order to solve the deep link collision issue, Android 6.0 (API Level 23) introduced [**Android App Links**](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links), which are [verified deep links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-site-associations "Verify Android App Links") based on a website URL explicitly registered by the developer. Clicking on an App Link will immediately open the app if it's installed.

There are some key differences from unverified deep links:

- App Links only use `http://` and `https://` schemes, any other custom URL schemes aren't allowed.
- App Links require a live domain to serve a [Digital Asset Links file](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started "Digital Asset Link") via HTTPS.
- App Links don't suffer from deep link collision since they don't show a disambiguation dialog when a user opens them.

## Declaring Deep Links

Deep links are declared with [`<intent-filter>` elements](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters#DataTest) on an `<activity>` in the `AndroidManifest.xml`. A browsable web deep link combines the `android.intent.action.VIEW` action, the `android.intent.category.DEFAULT` and `android.intent.category.BROWSABLE` categories, and one or more `<data>` elements that define the `scheme`, `host`, and `path`.

`<data>` elements within the same `<intent-filter>` are merged across all combinations of their attributes. See @MASTG-TECH-0172 for how to enumerate the resulting deep links.

## App Link Verification

An app opts into App Link verification by adding [`android:autoVerify="true"`](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks) to the `<intent-filter>`. When the app is installed, Android reaches out to each declared `android:host` and checks the [Digital Asset Links file](https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/v1/getting-started) served at `https://<host>/.well-known/assetlinks.json`. A deep link is treated as an App Link only after this verification succeeds.

Verification depends on the Digital Asset Links file being reachable and correct:

- It must be served over HTTPS and list the app's package name and signing certificate fingerprint.
- A server-side redirect (for example, `http` to `https`, or `example.com` to `www.example.com`) [stops Android from verifying](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks#fix-errors) the affected links.
- Each declared host, including every subdomain, needs its own file. A wildcard host (such as `*.example.com`) is verified against the file at the root domain.

The Android version also affects verification behavior:

- Before Android 12 (API level 31), a single [non-verifiable link](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/verify-android-applinks#fix-errors) (for example, a missing `autoVerify`, an invalid Digital Asset Links file, or a custom URL scheme in a verified intent filter) can cause the system to skip verification for all of the app's App Links.
- Starting with Android 12 (API level 31), a generic web intent [resolves to the user's default browser](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking) unless the target app is approved for the specific domain in the intent.

You can inspect the verification state on a device as described in @MASTG-TECH-0174.

## Handling Incoming Deep Links

The activity declared for a deep link receives the incoming URI through the [`Intent`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent) that launched it. The handler typically obtains it with [`getIntent()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#getIntent()) followed by [`Intent.getData()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#getData()), or through [`onNewIntent()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onNewIntent(android.content.Intent)) when the activity is already running.

Individual components of the resulting [`Uri`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/Uri) are read with methods such as [`getQueryParameter()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/Uri#getQueryParameter(java.lang.String)), [`getPathSegments()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/Uri#getPathSegments()), and [`getLastPathSegment()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/Uri#getLastPathSegment()). See @MASTG-DEMO-0152 for a handler that reads a query parameter from an incoming deep link.

Unlike iOS, which exposes the caller's bundle identifier through the `sourceApplication` property, Android provides no built-in mechanism for a deep link handler to identify which app sent the Intent. Any app on the device can send an Intent that matches an exported intent filter.

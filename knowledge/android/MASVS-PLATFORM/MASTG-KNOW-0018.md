On Android versions prior to 4.4, WebViews used the WebKit rendering engine to display web pages. Since Android 4.4, [WebViews have been based on Chromium](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/lollipop#WebView), providing improved performance and compatibility. However, the pages are still stripped down to minimal functions; for example, pages don't have address bars.

## URL Loading in WebViews

WebViews are Android's embedded components which allow your app to open web pages within your application. In addition to mobile apps related threats, WebViews may expose your app to common web threats (e.g. XSS, Open Redirect, etc.).

One of the most important things to do when testing WebViews is to make sure that only trusted content can be loaded in it. Any newly loaded page could be potentially malicious, try to exploit any WebView bindings or try to phish the user. Unless you're developing a browser app, usually you'd like to restrict the pages being loaded to the domain of your app. A good practice is to prevent the user from even having the chance to input any URLs inside WebViews (which is the default on Android) nor navigate outside the trusted domains. Even when navigating on trusted domains there's still the risk that the user might encounter and click on other links to untrustworthy content (e.g. if the page allows for other users to post comments). In addition, some developers might even override some default behavior which can be potentially dangerous for the user.

## WebViewClient

By default, any navigation request inside a WebView will be handled by the system's default web browser. This way, any navigation to a malicious page can't impact the original application, as the WebView doesn't share cookies or JavaScript bindings with the browser.

By assigning a WebViewClient to a WebView using `setWebViewClient`, all navigation will automatically be handled by the WebView itself. This is the worst-case configuration since any resource can now be loaded inside of the WebView, including malicious content. When a WebViewClient is assigned, the app must implement proper URL validation to ensure that only trusted content is loaded. This can be done by overriding `shouldOverrideUrlLoading` and/or `shouldInterceptRequest` and implementing allowlist or denylist patterns to restrict navigation to trusted content.

## SafeBrowsing API

To provide a safer web browsing experience, Android 8.1 (API level 27) introduces the [`SafeBrowsing API`](https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4), which allows your application to detect URLs that Google has classified as a known threat.

By default, WebViews show a warning to users about the security risk with the option to load the URL or stop the page from loading. With the SafeBrowsing API you can customize your application's behavior by either reporting the threat to SafeBrowsing or performing a particular action such as returning back to safety each time it encounters a known threat. Please check the [Android Developers documentation](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.1#safebrowsing) for usage examples.

You can use the SafeBrowsing API independently from WebViews using the [SafetyNet library](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/safebrowsing), which implements a client for Safe Browsing Network Protocol v4. SafetyNet allows you to analyze all the URLs that your app is supposed to load. You can check URLs with different schemes (e.g. http, file) since SafeBrowsing is agnostic to URL schemes, and against `TYPE_POTENTIALLY_HARMFUL_APPLICATION` and `TYPE_SOCIAL_ENGINEERING` threat types.

> When sending URLs or files to be checked for known threats make sure they don't contain sensitive data which could compromise a user's privacy, or expose sensitive content from your application.

## Virus Total API

Virus Total provides an API for analyzing URLs and local files for known threats. The API Reference is available on [Virus Total developers page](https://developers.virustotal.com/reference#getting-started "Getting Started").

## JavaScript Execution in WebViews

JavaScript can be injected into web applications via reflected, stored, or DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Mobile apps are executed in a sandboxed environment and don't have this vulnerability when implemented natively. Nevertheless, WebViews may be part of a native app to allow web page viewing.

Android WebViews can use [`setJavaScriptEnabled`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings#setJavaScriptEnabled(boolean)) to enable JavaScript execution. This feature is disabled by default. When enabled, JavaScript code executes in the context of the loaded page, including any scripts provided by that content.

## WebView-Native bridges

Android provides multiple mechanisms for communication between web content in a `WebView` and native app code, which differ in their design, capabilities, and security properties. Some are based on asynchronous message passing, while others use a synchronous injected object model.

For additional platform details, see Android's documentation on ["Access native APIs with JavaScript bridge"](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/webapps/native-api-access-jsbridge) and ["WebView – Native bridges"](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/risks/insecure-webview-native-bridges).

### `addWebMessageListener`

[`addWebMessageListener`](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/webapps/native-api-access-jsbridge) is a message based bridge API provided through AndroidX WebKit. Android describes it as the most modern and recommended approach for communication between web content and native app code. The app registers a listener object name, such as `myObject`, together with a set of `allowedOriginRules`. Matching pages receive an injected JavaScript proxy object that can exchange messages with the app asynchronously. The callback also provides metadata such as the sender origin, whether the message came from the main frame, and a reply proxy for sending a response.

Android documents this mechanism as allowlist-based. The injected object is exposed only to origins that match the configured origin rules, and the same mechanism can work across matching frames. The native side typically uses `WebViewCompat.addWebMessageListener(...)`, and the JavaScript side communicates through the injected proxy object's `postMessage` and `onmessage` APIs.

### `postWebMessage`

[`postWebMessage`](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/webapps/native-api-access-jsbridge) is an asynchronous messaging API that Android documents as an alternative similar to the web platform's `window.postMessage`. The app sends a payload to the web page's main frame with `WebViewCompat.postWebMessage(...)`. For bidirectional communication, the app can create a `WebMessageChannel` and transfer one of its ports to the page. Android characterizes this mechanism as origin aware and notes that it is limited to the main frame. The documentation also notes URI related constraints for content loaded with `data:`, `file:`, or `loadData()` unless `*` is used as the target origin.

### `addJavascriptInterface`

[`addJavascriptInterface`](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/webapps/native-api-access-jsbridge#addjavascriptinterface) is the oldest bridge mechanism. Android describes it as a synchronous legacy model. The app creates a Java or Kotlin object, annotates exposed methods with [`@JavascriptInterface`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/webkit/JavascriptInterface), and injects the object into the `WebView` with `addJavascriptInterface(Object, String)`. JavaScript can then call the exposed methods through the injected object name.

Android also notes several implementation details that are specific to this mechanism. The injected object is available to every frame in the `WebView`, including iframes, and the mechanism doesn't provide origin based access control. The bridge documentation also states that methods such as `WebView.getUrl()` aren't suitable for determining which frame invoked the interface. Android's security guidance also notes that before API level 21, JavaScript could use reflection to access the public fields of an injected object. This means that [reflection based RCE payloads](https://labs.withsecure.com/publications/webview-addjavascriptinterface-remote-code-execution) such as `window.jsinterface.getClass().forName('java.lang.Runtime').getMethod('getRuntime',null).invoke(...).exec(...)` were possible on older Android versions.

## WebView Local File Access Settings

These APIs control how a WebView accesses files on the local device. They determine whether the WebView can load files (such as HTML, images, or scripts) from the file system and whether JavaScript running in a local context can access additional local files. Note that accessing assets and resources (via file:///android_asset or file:///android_res) is always allowed regardless of these settings.

| API | Purpose | Defaults to `True` (API Level) | Defaults to `False` (API Level) | Deprecated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `setAllowFileAccess` | Permits the WebView to load files from the local file system (using `file://` URLs) | <= 29 (Android 10) | >= 30 (Android 11) | No |
| `setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs` | Allows JavaScript in a `file://` context to access other local `file://` URLs | <= 15 (Android 4.0.3) | >= 16 (Android 4.1) | Yes (since API level 30, Android 11) |
| `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` | Permits JavaScript in a `file://` context to access resources from any origin, bypassing the same-origin policy | <= 15 (Android 4.0.3) | >= 16 (Android 4.1) | Yes (since API level 30, Android 11) |

**What files can be accessed by the WebView?:**

The WebView can access any file that the app has permission to access via `file://` URLs, including:

- Internal storage: the app's own internal storage.
- External storage
    - Before Android 10:
        - the entire external storage (SD card), if the app has the `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission.
    - Since Android 10:
        - only the app-specific directories (due to scoped storage restrictions) without any special permissions.
        - entire media folders (including data from other apps) if the app has the `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` or similar permissions.
        - the entire external storage if the app has the `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission.

### `setAllowFileAccess`

[`setAllowFileAccess`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings.html#setAllowFileAccess%28boolean%29 "Method setAllowFileAccess()") enables the WebView to load local files using the `file://` scheme. In this example, the WebView is configured to allow file access and then loads an HTML file from the external storage (sdcard).

```kotlin
webView.settings.apply {
    allowFileAccess = true
}
webView.loadUrl("file:///sdcard/index.html");
```

### `setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs`

[`setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings.html#setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs%28boolean%29 "Method setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs()") allows the local file (loaded via file://) to access additional local resources from its HTML or JavaScript.

Note that the value of [**this setting is ignored**](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings#setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs(boolean)) if the value of `allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` is `true`.

> [Chromium WebView Docs](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/android_webview/docs/cors-and-webview-api.md#setallowfileaccessfromfileurls): With this relaxed origin rule, URLs starting with `content://` and `file://` can access resources that have the same relaxed origin over `XMLHttpRequest`. For instance, `file://foo` can make an `XMLHttpRequest` to `file://bar`. Developers need to be careful so that a user provided data do not run in `content://` as it will allow the user's code to access arbitrary `content://` URLs those are provided by other applications. It will cause a serious security issue.
>
> Regardless of this API call, the [Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-api) does not allow accessing `content://` and `file://` URLs.

**Example:** In this example, the WebView is configured to allow file access and then loads an HTML file from the external storage (sdcard).

```java
webView.settings.apply {
    allowFileAccess = true
    allowFileAccessFromFileURLs = true
}
webView.loadUrl("file:///sdcard/local_page.html");
```

The loaded HTML file contains an image that is loaded via a `file://` URL:

```html
<!-- In local_page.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Local Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- This image is loaded via a file:// URL -->
    <img src="file:///android_asset/images/logo.png" alt="Logo">
  </body>
</html>
```

### `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs`

[`setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings.html#setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs%28boolean%29 "Method setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs()") allows JavaScript running in a local file (loaded via `file://`) to bypass the same-origin policy and access resources from any origin.

> [Chromium WebView Docs](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/android_webview/docs/cors-and-webview-api.md#setallowuniversalaccessfromfileurls): When this API is called with true, URLs starting with `file://` will have a scheme based origin, and can access other scheme based URLs over `XMLHttpRequest`. For instance, `file://foo` can make an `XMLHttpRequest` to `content://bar`, `http://example.com/`, and `https://www.google.com/`. So developers need to manage data running under the `file://` scheme as it allows powerful permissions beyond the public web's CORS policy.
>
> Regardless of this API call, [Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-api) does not allow to access `content://` and `file://` URLs.

**Example:** In this example, the local HTML file successfully makes a cross-origin request to fetch data from an HTTPS endpoint. This can be potentially abused by an attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data from the app.

```kotlin
webView.settings.apply {
    javaScriptEnabled = true
    allowFileAccess = true
    allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs = true
}
webView.loadUrl("file:///android_asset/local_page.html");
```

Contents of local_page.html (in the assets folder):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Universal Access Demo</title>
    <script>
      // This AJAX call fetches data from a remote server despite being loaded via file://
      fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
        .then(response => response.text())
        .then(data => document.getElementById("output").innerText = data)
        .catch(err => console.error(err));
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="output">Loading...</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Note about accessing cookies:**

Setting `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs(true)` allows JavaScript inside a local `file://` to make cross-origin requests (XHR, Fetch, etc.). This bypasses the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) for network requests, but it doesn't grant access to cookies from remote websites.

- Cookies are managed by the WebView's CookieManager and can't be accessed by a `file://` origin unless explicitly allowed via document.cookie (which most modern sites prevent using `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags).
- Cross-origin requests also don't include cookies unless explicitly allowed by the server via CORS headers such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.

## WebView Content Provider Access

WebViews can access [content providers](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers), which are used to share data between applications. Content providers can be accessed by other apps only if they are exported (`android:exported` attribute set to `true`), but even if the content provider isn't exported, it can be accessed by a WebView in the application itself.

The setting `setAllowContentAccess` controls whether the WebView can access content providers using `content://` URLs. This setting is enabled by default for Android 4.1 (API level 16) and above.

> [Chromium WebView Docs](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/HEAD/android_webview/docs/cors-and-webview-api.md#content_urls):
> `content://` URLs are used to access resources provided via Android Content Providers. The access should be permitted via `setAllowContentAccess` API beforehand. `content://` pages can contain iframes that load `content://` pages, but the parent frame can not access into the iframe contents. Also only `content://` pages can specify `content://` URLs for sub-resources.
>
> However, even pages loaded from `content://` can not make any [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)-enabled requests such as `XMLHttpRequest` to other `content://` URLs as each one is assumed to belong to an [opaque origin](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#concept-origin-opaque). See also `setAllowFileAccessFromFileURLs` and `setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` sections as they can relax this default rule.
>
> Pages loaded with any scheme other than `content://` can't load `content://` page in iframes and they can not specify `content://` URLs for sub-resources.

**Example:** In this example, the WebView's `allowContentAccess` property is enabled and a `content://` URL is loaded.

```kotlin
webView.settings.apply {
    allowContentAccess = true
}
webView.loadUrl("content://com.example.myapp.provider/data")
```

**Which files can be accessed by the WebView?:**

The WebView can access any data accessible via content providers (if the app has any) using `content://` URLs. **Unless otherwise further restricted by the content provider**, this could include:

- Internal storage: the entire internal storage.
- External storage
    - Before Android 10:
        - the entire external storage (SD card), if the app has the `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission.
    - Since Android 10:
        - only the app-specific directories (due to scoped storage restrictions) without any special permissions.
        - entire media folders (including data from other apps) if the app has the `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` or similar permissions.
        - the entire external storage if the app has the `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission.

Data from other apps accessible via content providers (if the app has any and they are exported) can also be accessed.

## WebView Storage

Android WebView embeds a Chromium based browser engine. Every app has its own WebView cache, which isn't shared with the native Browser or other apps. Most web related data is stored inside the Chromium profile directory located at:

`/data/data/<app_package>/app_webview/`

Android WebView can persist several categories of data for each origin.

- **Cached network resources** created when a server sends cache permissive headers such as Cache Control or Expires. These resources are stored in memory and on disk inside the [Chromium cache](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/storage/cache).
- **DOM storage** such as [LocalStorage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/storage/localstorage) and [SessionStorage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/storage/sessionstorage)
- [**WebSQL**](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/storage/websql), removed in modern WebView versions
- [**IndexedDB**](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/storage/indexeddb)
- [**Cookies**](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/application/cookies) including session and persistent cookies
- **Files backed by the Origin Private File System (OPFS)** including the [**SQLite Wasm**](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/sqlite-wasm-in-the-browser-backed-by-the-origin-private-file-system) database

OPFS and SQLite Wasm are internal to the Chromium storage layer. Their contents don't appear as ordinary files in the app sandbox.

### Configuration and Defaults

Storage behavior can be influenced by calls on `android.webkit.WebSettings` such as:

- [`WebSettings.setCacheMode`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/webkit/WebSettings#setCacheMode(kotlin.Int))
- [`WebSettings.setDomStorageEnabled`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings#setDomStorageEnabled(boolean))
- [`WebSettings.setDatabaseEnabled`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings#setDatabaseEnabled(boolean)) [deprecated with WebSQL in Android version 15 (API level 35)](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/deprecations#websql-webview)
- `WebSettings.setAppCacheEnabled` [deprecated and removed in Android 13 (API level 33)](https://developer.android.com/sdk/api_diff/33/changes/android.webkit.WebSettings#removed-methods-setAppCacheEnabled(boolean))

Network cache is enabled by default and obeys the HTTP cache headers sent by the server. DOM storage is enabled by default on all supported WebView versions. Database related flags are deprecated and no longer control IndexedDB or other modern storage. Cookies are accepted by default unless an app disables them through `CookieManager`.

### Clearing Stored Data

Android doesn't provide a dedicated API to delete the Chromium profile under `app_webview`. Apps must not attempt to delete this directory directly. The only supported way to remove it is to clear the app's data, either through system settings or by calling `ActivityManager.clearApplicationUserData()`. However, this might not be desirable if the app wants to retain other user data.

A more adequate approach is to clear individual storage subsystems used by WebView. These include:

- **Cached Resources**: [`WebView.clearCache`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView#clearCache(boolean))(true) clears the memory and disk HTTP cache. It doesn't remove cookies, DOM storage, IndexedDB, OPFS, or other persistent data.
- **WebStorage APIs**: [`WebStorage.deleteAllData`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebStorage#deleteAllData()) clears DOM storage and legacy WebSQL. It doesn't clear IndexedDB or OPFS.
- **Cookies**: [`CookieManager.removeAllCookies`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/CookieManager#removeAllCookies(android.webkit.ValueCallback%3Cjava.lang.Boolean%3E)) removes all cookies for the app.
- **IndexedDB and OPFS**: IndexedDB and OPFS are managed internally by Chromium and aren't covered by the WebStorage API. They can't be deleted with Java file APIs such as [`java.io.File.deleteRecursively`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.io/java.io.-file/delete-recursively.html). Clearing requires deleting the entire WebView profile.
- **SQLite Wasm**: SQLite Wasm databases live inside OPFS. They aren't Android SQLite databases and can't be controlled using Android APIs such as [`SQLiteDatabase.delete`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase#delete(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String[])) or [`SQLiteDatabase.deleteDatabase`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase#deleteDatabase(java.io.File)). Clearing requires deleting the entire WebView profile.

**Example:**

This example in Kotlin from the [open source Firefox Focus](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/blob/v8.17.1/app/src/main/java/org/mozilla/focus/webview/SystemWebView.kt#L220 "Firefox Focus for Android") app shows different cleanup steps:

```kotlin
override fun cleanup() {
    clearFormData() // Removes the autocomplete popup from the currently focused form field, if present. Note that this only affects the display of the autocomplete popup. It does not remove any saved form data from this WebView's store. To do that, use WebViewDatabase#clearFormData.
    clearHistory()
    clearMatches()
    clearSslPreferences()
    clearCache(true)

    CookieManager.getInstance().removeAllCookies(null)

    WebStorage.getInstance().deleteAllData() // Clears all storage currently being used by the JavaScript storage APIs. This includes the Application Cache, Web SQL Database, and the HTML5 Web Storage APIs.

    val webViewDatabase = WebViewDatabase.getInstance(context)
    // It isn't entirely clear how this differs from WebView.clearFormData()
    @Suppress("DEPRECATION")
    webViewDatabase.clearFormData() // Clears any saved data for web forms.
    webViewDatabase.clearHttpAuthUsernamePassword()

    deleteContentFromKnownLocations(context) // Calls FileUtils.deleteWebViewDirectory(context) which deletes all content in "app_webview".
}
```

The function finishes with some extra _manual_ file deletion in `deleteContentFromKnownLocations` which calls functions from [`FileUtils`](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/focus-android/blob/v8.17.1/app/src/main/java/org/mozilla/focus/utils/FileUtils.kt#L24-L44). These functions use the [`java.io.File.deleteRecursively`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.io/java.io.-file/delete-recursively.html) method to delete files from the specified directories recursively.

```kt
private fun deleteContent(directory: File, doNotEraseWhitelist: Set<String> = emptySet()): Boolean {
    val filesToDelete = directory.listFiles()?.filter { !doNotEraseWhitelist.contains(it.name) } ?: return false
    return filesToDelete.all { it.deleteRecursively() }
}
```

### Challenges of Testing WebView Cache Cleanup

Testing WebView cleanup is a complex task that requires extensive information gathering and has several challenges:

1. Firstly, the tester needs to identify the number of WebView instances and their respective `WebSettings`, and any potential correlation to ensure confinement of test results to only the tested WebView instance.
2. Secondly, for each WebView instance, the tester needs to identify how the storage areas are configured and how the data is actually being stored based on HTTP cache headers and web storage configuration.
3. Thirdly, the tester must determine the lifecycle of every sensitive data item and its designated retention period.
4. Finally, there is a lack of a guarantee that the clear methods will always be called, particularly if the app process is killed abruptly before those occur (e.g., due to a system process kill), and in sequence if mitigation measures exist for these scenarios.

## Alternatives to WebView

[Trusted Web Activities](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/webapps/trusted-web-activities) and [Custom Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/overview/) let your app display web content in the user's browser. With these options, JavaScript runs in the browser environment, and behavior follows the browser's security model and update cycle. For details on capabilities, limitations, and integration guidance, refer to the official Android and Chrome documentation.

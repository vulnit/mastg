A [broadcast receiver](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts) is an app component that responds to broadcast messages from other apps or from the system. Apps use broadcasts as a publish-subscribe messaging mechanism: the system delivers broadcasts for events such as boot completion or connectivity changes, and apps can send their own broadcasts to communicate between components or with other apps. A broadcast receiver extends the [`BroadcastReceiver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver) class and implements [`onReceive`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/BroadcastReceiver#onReceive(android.content.Context,%20android.content.Intent)).

Broadcasts are built on top of the [`Intent`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent) system and are an inter-process communication (IPC), entry point, subject to access controls such as `android:exported`, `android:permission`, runtime receiver export flags, and broadcast permissions. This makes receiver visibility directly relevant to the app's attack surface. See @MASTG-KNOW-0020 for the IPC model and @MASTG-KNOW-0025 for implicit intents.

## Registration

A broadcast receiver can be made known to the system in two ways.

**Manifest-declared receivers** are declared in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file with a [`<receiver>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/receiver-element) element and usually an associated intent filter:

```xml
<receiver android:name=".MyReceiver" android:exported="false">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.example.app.MY_ACTION" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

Manifest-declared receivers can restrict which apps may send broadcasts to them with the [`android:permission`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/receiver-element#prmsn) attribute. The sender must hold the named permission, otherwise the broadcast isn't delivered to the receiver.

**Context-registered receivers** are registered at runtime by calling `registerReceiver()` with an [`IntentFilter`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/IntentFilter), and unregistered with `unregisterReceiver()`. They receive broadcasts only while their registering context is valid.

`Context.registerReceiver()` is the Android platform API. Relevant overloads include:

- [`registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver receiver, IntentFilter filter)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#registerReceiver(android.content.BroadcastReceiver,%20android.content.IntentFilter))
- [`registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver receiver, IntentFilter filter, int flags)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#registerReceiver(android.content.BroadcastReceiver,%20android.content.IntentFilter,%20int))
- [`registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver receiver, IntentFilter filter, String broadcastPermission, Handler scheduler)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#registerReceiver(android.content.BroadcastReceiver,%20android.content.IntentFilter,%20java.lang.String,%20android.os.Handler))
- [`registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver receiver, IntentFilter filter, String broadcastPermission, Handler scheduler, int flags)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#registerReceiver(android.content.BroadcastReceiver,%20android.content.IntentFilter,%20java.lang.String,%20android.os.Handler,%20int))

`ContextCompat.registerReceiver()` is the AndroidX compatibility wrapper. It provides a consistent way to use the runtime receiver export flags across supported Android versions. Relevant overloads include:

- [`ContextCompat.registerReceiver(Context context, BroadcastReceiver receiver, IntentFilter filter, int flags)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/content/ContextCompat#registerReceiver(android.content.Context,android.content.BroadcastReceiver,android.content.IntentFilter,int))
- [`ContextCompat.registerReceiver(Context context, BroadcastReceiver receiver, IntentFilter filter, String broadcastPermission, Handler scheduler, int flags)`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/content/ContextCompat#registerReceiver(android.content.Context,android.content.BroadcastReceiver,android.content.IntentFilter,java.lang.String,android.os.Handler,int))

For context-registered receivers, security controls are set through the following arguments of the relevant `registerReceiver()` overloads:

- `flags`: controls whether the receiver can receive broadcasts from other apps. Use `RECEIVER_EXPORTED` when the receiver needs to receive broadcasts from other apps, and use `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` when it should receive broadcasts only from the same app or from the system UID. Since Android 14 (API level 34), [apps targeting Android 14 or higher must explicitly specify the runtime export flags](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/behavior-changes-14#runtime-receivers-exported) when registering a receiver that isn't exclusively for system broadcasts.
- `broadcastPermission`: requires the sender to hold the named permission before the broadcast is delivered to the receiver. If `broadcastPermission` is `null`, no sender permission is required.

## Sending Broadcasts

Apps send broadcasts with methods on [`Context`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context):

- [`sendBroadcast`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#sendBroadcast(android.content.Intent)): delivers to all interested receivers in an undefined order.
- [`sendOrderedBroadcast`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#sendOrderedBroadcast(android.content.Intent,%20java.lang.String)): delivers to one receiver at a time according to priority, allowing a receiver to abort the broadcast or pass data to the next.
- [`LocalBroadcastManager`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/localbroadcastmanager/content/LocalBroadcastManager) historically kept broadcasts within a single app. It is now [deprecated](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/localbroadcastmanager/content/LocalBroadcastManager); Google recommends alternatives such as [`LiveData`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/LiveData) or observable data holders for in-app communication.

## Implicit vs Explicit Broadcasts

A broadcast is **implicit** when it doesn't target a specific app. After receiving an implicit broadcast, the system lists all receivers registered for the action and delivers it to each. A broadcast is **explicit** when it names a target package or component.

Background execution limits constrain implicit broadcasts:

- Apps targeting Android 8.0 (API level 26) or higher can't register most implicit broadcasts in the manifest, with limited [exceptions](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcast-exceptions). Context-registered receivers aren't affected.
- [Sticky broadcasts](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/risks/sticky-broadcast), sent with the deprecated `sendStickyBroadcast` family of methods, persist after delivery and offer no access control.

## Priority

A receiver's priority for ordered broadcasts can be set with the [`android:priority`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/intent-filter-element#priority) attribute in an intent filter or programmatically with [`IntentFilter.setPriority`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/IntentFilter#setPriority(int)). Receivers with the same priority run in an arbitrary order.

## Access Control

Whether other apps can deliver broadcasts to a receiver, or receive broadcasts the app sends, is governed by:

- [`android:exported`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/receiver-element#exported): for manifest-declared receivers, when `true`, components of other apps can send broadcasts to the receiver unless another control, such as `android:permission`, blocks the sender. When `false`, access is limited to the same app, apps with the same user ID, or privileged system components. When a manifest receiver declares an intent filter, the default historically became `true`; in its absence the default is `false`. Since Android 12 (API level 31), the attribute must be set explicitly when an intent filter is present.
- [`android:permission`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/receiver-element#prmsn): for manifest-declared receivers, requires the sender to hold a specific permission to deliver broadcasts to the receiver. If the sender isn't granted the permission, the intent isn't delivered to the receiver. Combined with a custom permission and an appropriate [`android:protectionLevel`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/permission-element#plevel) (for example, `signature`), this restricts which apps can interact with the component. See @MASTG-KNOW-0017 for permission protection levels, component permission enforcement, and custom permissions, and see [Permission-based access control to exported components](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/risks/access-control-to-exported-components).
- `flags` argument in `registerReceiver()` overloads: for context-registered receivers, these flags control whether the receiver can receive broadcasts from other apps. `RECEIVER_EXPORTED` makes the receiver visible to other apps. `RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED` prevents the receiver from receiving broadcasts from other apps.
- `broadcastPermission` argument in `registerReceiver()` overloads: for context-registered receivers, setting this argument requires the sender to hold the named permission before the broadcast is delivered to the receiver. If it is `null`, no sender permission is required.
- Setting an explicit target package or component on the `Intent` limits delivery to that app. See [Security considerations and best practices](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts#security-and-best-practices) and [Insecure broadcast receivers](https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/risks/insecure-broadcast-receiver).

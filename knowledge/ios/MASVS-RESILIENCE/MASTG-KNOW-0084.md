title: Jailbreak Detection
---

Jailbreak detection mechanisms are added to reverse engineering defense to make running the app on a jailbroken device more difficult. This blocks some of the tools and techniques reverse engineers like to use. Like most other types of defense, jailbreak detection isn't very effective by itself, but scattering checks throughout the app's source code can improve the effectiveness of the overall anti-tampering scheme.

## Common Jailbreak Detection Checks

Here we present three typical jailbreak detection techniques:

**File-based Checks:**

The app might be checking for files and directories typically associated with jailbreaks, such as:

```default
/Applications/Cydia.app
/Applications/FakeCarrier.app
/Applications/Icy.app
/Applications/IntelliScreen.app
/Applications/MxTube.app
/Applications/RockApp.app
/Applications/SBSettings.app
/Applications/WinterBoard.app
/Applications/blackra1n.app
/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/LiveClock.plist
/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/Veency.plist
/Library/MobileSubstrate/MobileSubstrate.dylib
/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.ikey.bbot.plist
/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.saurik.Cydia.Startup.plist
/bin/bash
/bin/sh
/etc/apt
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
/private/var/lib/apt
/private/var/lib/cydia
/private/var/mobile/Library/SBSettings/Themes
/private/var/stash
/private/var/tmp/cydia.log
/var/tmp/cydia.log
/usr/bin/sshd
/usr/libexec/sftp-server
/usr/libexec/ssh-keysign
/usr/sbin/sshd
/var/cache/apt
/var/lib/apt
/var/lib/cydia
/usr/sbin/frida-server
/usr/bin/cycript
/usr/local/bin/cycript
/usr/lib/libcycript.dylib
/var/log/syslog
```

**Checking File Permissions:**

The app might be trying to write to a location that's outside the application's sandbox. For instance, it may attempt to create a file in, for example, the `/private` directory. If the file is created successfully, the app can assume that the device has been jailbroken.

```swift
do {
    let pathToFileInRestrictedDirectory = "/private/jailbreak.txt"
    try "This is a test.".write(toFile: pathToFileInRestrictedDirectory, atomically: true, encoding: String.Encoding.utf8)
    try FileManager.default.removeItem(atPath: pathToFileInRestrictedDirectory)
    // Device is jailbroken
} catch {
    // Device is not jailbroken
}
```

**Checking Protocol Handlers:**

The app might be attempting to call well-known protocol handlers such as `cydia://` (available by default after installing @MASTG-TOOL-0047).

```swift
if let url = URL(string: "cydia://package/com.example.package"), UIApplication.shared.canOpenURL(url) {
    // Device is jailbroken
}
```

## Jailbreak Detection Bypass

Beyond detecting their presence, these checks can often be circumvented using dynamic instrumentation tools or manual reverse engineering. @MASTG-TECH-0152 describes the techniques used to identify and bypass jailbreak detection implementations.

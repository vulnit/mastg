Starting with iOS 8, Apple introduced [App Extensions](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014214-CH20-SW1 "App Extensions Increase Your Impact"). App extensions let an app offer custom functionality and content to users while they interact with other apps or the system. Each extension implements a single, well-scoped task, for example defining what happens after the user taps the "Share" button, providing the content of a widget, or implementing a custom keyboard.

Each extension has exactly one type, defined by its [`NSExtensionPointIdentifier`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsextension/nsextensionpointidentifier) (the so-called _extension point_). Some notable types are:

- **Custom Keyboard:** replaces the iOS system keyboard with a custom keyboard for use in all apps.
- **Share:** posts to a sharing website or shares content with others.
- **Action:** manipulates or views content originating in a host app.
- **Today (widgets):** shows content or performs quick tasks in the Today view and on the Home Screen.

## How App Extensions Interact with Other Apps

Three roles are involved:

- **App extension:** the binary bundled inside a containing app. Host apps interact with it.
- **Host app:** the (often third-party) app that triggers the app extension. For example, the app whose share sheet the user opens.
- **Containing app:** the app that ships the app extension bundled inside it.

For example, the user selects text in the _host app_, taps the "Share" button, and selects an app or action from the list. This triggers the _app extension_ of the corresponding _containing app_. The extension displays its view in the context of the host app and uses the items the host app provides (the selected text in this case) to perform its task. The following figure from the [Apple App Extension Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014214-CH2-SW13 "An app extension can communicate indirectly with its containing app") summarizes this interaction:

## Process Model and Sandboxing

An app extension runs as its own process, separate from both its containing app and the host app, and each has its own sandbox:

- An app extension never communicates directly with its containing app. Typically, the containing app isn't even running while the extension is. Shared state is usually handled through an [App Group shared container](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-app-groups), and shared keychain items through a [Keychain Access Group](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/sharing-access-to-keychain-items-among-a-collection-of-apps).
- An app extension and the host app communicate through system mediated inter-process communication, using the higher level APIs provided by the extension point and the system. See Apple's [App Extension Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionOverview.html) and [Apple Platform Security](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/supporting-extensions-secabd3504cd/web).
- An app extension's containing app and the host app don't communicate at all.

The platform also restricts what extensions can do. For example:

- app extensions can't access some APIs, such as APIs marked unavailable to extensions or unavailable frameworks like HealthKit in the older iOS app extension model
- can't receive data through AirDrop, although they can send it
- can't run long running background tasks, although they can start uploads and downloads with `URLSession`
- can't access the camera or microphone on iOS, except for iMessage app extensions with the required usage descriptions. See Apple's ["Some APIs Are Unavailable to App Extensions"](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionOverview.html) and ["Creating an App Extension"](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionCreation.html).

There used to be a special type of app extension called a "Today" extension, also known as a "Today widget", that could run in Today View, but in iOS 18 Apple has [removed](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18-release-notes) this model in favor of WidgetKit widgets. This extension was the only one that could ask the system to open its containing app by calling [`openURL:completionHandler:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsextensioncontext/open%28_%3Acompletionhandler%3A%29) on its `NSExtensionContext`. In WidgetKit, widgets declare [`Link` or `widgetURL(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/adding-interactivity-to-widgets-and-live-activities), and when the user taps it, the system opens the corresponding app URL. Apple describes this as the way to [open the app from a widget or Live Activity](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/widgetkit/linking-to-specific-app-scenes-from-your-widget-or-live-activity).

## Code Signing and Distribution

An app extension isn't an independent, separately installable app. It is embedded in the `PlugIns/` directory of its containing app (each extension bundle uses the `.appex` suffix) and is distributed, signed, and provisioned together with that containing app. Both the containing app and its extensions are signed under the same Apple Developer Team and, for App Store distribution, go through Apple's app review. As a result, a containing app and its bundled extensions belong to the same developer.

## Sharing Data via App Groups

By default, an app extension and its containing app have separate containers and can't read each other's data. They can opt into a shared container through [App Groups](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_application-groups). The following figure from the [Apple App Extension Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionScenarios.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014214-CH21-SW11 "An app extension's container is distinct from its containing app's container") illustrates the default separation:

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x06h/app_extensions_container_restrictions.png" width="400px" />

Access to a shared container is gated by entitlements and code signing:

- Each member (containing app and extension) must declare the `com.apple.security.application-groups` entitlement with the same group identifier (for example, `group.org.owasp.mastestapp`).
- App Group identifiers are namespaced to the developer's Apple Developer Team, and the entitlement is enforced by the provisioning profile and code signature. Only binaries signed by the same team and provisioned with that group can join the container.

Members of the same App Group typically exchange data through:

- [`UserDefaults(suiteName:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults/init(suitename:)) for shared user defaults.
- [`FileManager.containerURL(forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filemanager/containerurl(forsecurityapplicationgroupidentifier:)) for a shared file container, located under `/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/<UUID>/`.
- An [`NSPersistentContainer`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nspersistentcontainer) configured to use the App Group container for shared Core Data storage.

A shared container is also required when an extension uses `NSURLSession` for background uploads or downloads, so that both the extension and the containing app can access the transferred data.

Two properties of the shared container are relevant when reasoning about the data it holds:

- All members of the App Group have equal read/write access to everything in the shared container; the container has no per-item access control between members.
- Files written to the shared container are protected by [Data Protection](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/protecting_the_user_s_privacy/encrypting_your_app_s_files) according to their file protection class, just like files in an app's private container. The default class is `NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication`; `NSFileProtectionComplete` keeps file contents encrypted while the device is locked. See @MASTG-KNOW-0091 for the data protection classes.

For credentials and other secrets that both the app and the extension need, the [Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services) supports sharing through a [Keychain Access Group](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/sharing-access-to-keychain-items-among-a-collection-of-apps) (`keychain-access-groups` entitlement), which provides dedicated key storage with its own accessibility controls, independent of the App Group file container.

## Declaring Supported Data Types

Share and action extensions declare the data they can receive through the [`NSExtensionActivationRule`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/ExtensionScenarios.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014214-CH21-SW8 "Declaring Supported Data Types for a Share or Action Extension") key in the extension's `Info.plist`. The rule lists the supported Uniform Type Identifiers (UTIs) and the maximum item counts, for example:

```xml
<key>NSExtensionAttributes</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSExtensionActivationRule</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSExtensionActivationSupportsImageWithMaxCount</key>
        <integer>10</integer>
        <key>NSExtensionActivationSupportsMovieWithMaxCount</key>
        <integer>1</integer>
        <key>NSExtensionActivationSupportsWebURLWithMaxCount</key>
        <integer>1</integer>
    </dict>
</dict>
```

More complex matching is possible with a predicate string evaluated against the offered UTIs. `NSExtensionActivationRule` determines whether the extension is _offered_ to the user for a given item (for example, whether it appears in the share sheet); it filters availability in the host app's UI and isn't an access-control boundary on the data itself.

App Groups is an entitlement-based mechanism that lets apps and extensions from the same developer team share a common file container, shared preferences, or files such as SQLite databases.

## Entitlement

An app opts into an App Group by enabling the [App Groups capability](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-app-groups) and adding the [`com.apple.security.application-groups`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.application-groups) entitlement. The App ID and provisioning profile must allow the same group identifier. The group identifier follows the format `group.<reverse-DNS-string>` and is tied to the developer team.

All apps and extensions sharing the same group identifier can access the shared resources. Different developer teams can't use the same app group.

## Shared Storage

The shared container is a directory on the file system accessible via [`containerURL(forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filemanager/containerurl(forsecurityapplicationgroupidentifier:)):

```swift
FileManager.default.containerURL(forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier: "group.com.example.myapp")
```

Apps typically use this location to store:

- Shared `UserDefaults` via `UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.com.example.myapp")`.
- SQLite databases, Core Data stores, or other files shared between the main app and its extensions, such as a widget or a Share extension.
- Shared preference files or configuration data.

## Scope and Constraints

- The shared container is accessible to all apps and extensions enrolled in the group, running on the same device.
- App Groups don't enable sharing between apps from different developer teams.
- App Groups don't add an extra encryption layer. Files in the shared container rely on the standard iOS file system protections and the Data Protection class applied to each file.
- Widgets, notification content extensions, and other app extensions commonly use App Groups to read data shared by their containing app.
- Any app or extension in the group can read or modify shared data, so sensitive data should be minimized and access should be controlled at the application layer.

## Relationship to Other Mechanisms

App extensions (see @MASTG-KNOW-0082) commonly use App Groups as their primary data-sharing channel with the containing app. File coordination (see @MASTG-KNOW-0127) is recommended when multiple processes read and write the same file in the shared container concurrently.

WebViews are in-app browser components for displaying interactive web content. They can be used to embed web content directly into an app's user interface. iOS WebViews execute JavaScript and render HTML, and therefore can execute injected scripts when untrusted content is rendered.

## Types of WebViews

There are multiple ways to include a WebView in an iOS application.

### WKWebView

[`WKWebView`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/webkit/wkwebview "WKWebView") was introduced with iOS 8 and is the appropriate choice for extending app functionality, controlling displayed content (i.e., prevent the user from navigating to arbitrary URLs) and customizing.

`WKWebView` comes with several security advantages over `UIWebView`:

- JavaScript is enabled by default but it can be completely disabled using the `javaScriptEnabled` property of `WKWebView`, which helps mitigate script injection attacks by preventing injected scripts from executing.
- The `javaScriptCanOpenWindowsAutomatically` property can be used to prevent JavaScript from opening new windows, such as pop-ups.
- `WKWebView` implements out-of-process rendering, so memory corruption bugs won't affect the main app process.

A JavaScript Bridge can be enabled when using `WKWebView` and `UIWebView`. See Section ["WebView-Native Bridges"](#webview-native-bridges) below for more information.

### SFSafariViewController

[`SFSafariViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller "SFSafariViewController") is available starting on iOS 9 and should be used to provide a generalized web viewing experience. These WebViews can be easily spotted as they have a characteristic layout which includes the following elements:

- A read-only address field with a security indicator.
- An Action ("Share") button.
- A Done button, back and forward navigation buttons, and a "Safari" button to open the page directly in Safari.

There are a couple of things to consider:

- JavaScript can't be disabled in `SFSafariViewController` and this is one of the reasons why the usage of `WKWebView` is recommended when the goal is extending the app's user interface.
- `SFSafariViewController` also shares cookies and other website data with Safari.
- The user's activity and interaction with a `SFSafariViewController` aren't visible to the app, which can't access AutoFill data, browsing history, or website data.
- According to the App Store Review Guidelines, `SFSafariViewController`s may not be hidden or obscured by other views or layers.

This should be sufficient for an app analysis and therefore, `SFSafariViewController`s are out of scope for the Static and Dynamic Analysis sections.

### UIWebView (DEPRECATED since iOS 12, don't use)

[`UIWebView`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiwebview) was deprecated by Apple in iOS 12 and has since been superseded by `WKWebView` and `SFSafariViewController` for embedding web content. Reasons commonly cited include its older security model, the lack of support for disabling JavaScript, and the availability of more modern configuration and isolation controls in its successors.

## WebView Network Security

The engine behind iOS WebViews is WebKit, which is also used by the Safari browser. This means that WebViews are subject to the same network security policies as Safari, including App Transport Security (ATS) and mixed content restrictions. However, developers can configure these policies differently for WebViews than for the rest of the app, which can lead to security issues if not done carefully.

### ATS

iOS WebViews are subject to the same App Transport Security (ATS) policies as the rest of the app. ATS has a specific policy for WebViews, which allows developers to relax security for web content while keeping the rest of the app secure. This is controlled by the [`NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information-property-list/nsapptransportsecurity/nsallowsarbitraryloadsinwebcontent) key in the app's Info.plist file. If this key is set to `true`, it allows WebViews to load content over insecure HTTP connections, even if the rest of the app is restricted by ATS.

### Mixed Content

WebViews can load both HTTP and HTTPS content, which may lead to [mixed content](https://web.dev/articles/fixing-mixed-content) situations. Mixed content occurs when an HTTPS page attempts to load resources such as scripts, images, or iframes over HTTP. This weakens the security guarantees of the HTTPS page because the insecure resource could be modified by an attacker. You can learn more about mixed content in the ["Mozilla Docs for Mixed Content"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Defenses/Mixed_content) and in the ["web.dev article for Fixing mixed content"](https://web.dev/articles/fixing-mixed-content).

Mixed content is typically divided into **active** and **passive** types. Active mixed content includes resources that can execute or modify the page, such as scripts, stylesheets, or iframes. Passive mixed content includes resources such as images, audio, or video that are displayed but don't directly execute code. In modern browsers and WebKit, **active mixed content is blocked**, while **passive mixed content is often automatically upgraded to HTTPS if possible**, or otherwise blocked and reported with a warning.

In `WKWebView`, active mixed content such as HTTP scripts loaded by an HTTPS page is generally **blocked by WebKit itself**, even if the application relaxes App Transport Security. For example, setting `NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent` allows insecure network requests from WebViews from the ATS perspective, but it **doesn't disable WebKit's mixed content protections**. As a result, an HTTPS page that tries to load an HTTP script will typically have that resource blocked. See ["WebKit Features in Safari 18.0" (September 2024)](https://webkit.org/blog/15865/webkit-features-in-safari-18-0/#https).

The API [`hasOnlySecureContent`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/hasonlysecurecontent) can be used after a page finishes loading to determine whether the WebView ultimately loaded only secure resources. However, it is **informational rather than preventive**. It reflects the final security state of the page, not whether the page attempted to load insecure resources that were blocked.

Because WebKit enforces these protections and they can't be disabled through public `WKWebView` APIs, active mixed content can only be loaded when the page itself is requested over HTTP, regardless of ATS settings such as `NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent`.

## Loading Content

### Loading Remote URLs

iOS apps can load remote URLs into a WebView using the [`load(_:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/load(_:)) API, which starts a top level navigation from the supplied [`URLRequest`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Foundation/URLRequest).

`WKWebView` network communication sits on top of `URLSession`, so its `load(_:)` API is subject to App Transport Security.

### Loading Local Files

When loading local files, developers typically use one of the following methods:

- [`loadHTMLString:baseURL:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/loadhtmlstring(_:baseurl:)): loads HTML content from a string with a specified base URL.
- [`loadData:MIMEType:characterEncodingName:baseURL:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/load(_:mimetype:characterencodingname:baseurl:)): loads data with a specified MIME type and base URL.
- [`loadFileURL:allowingReadAccessToURL:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/loadfileurl(_:allowingreadaccessto:)): loads a file from the local file system with controlled read access.
- [`loadFileRequest:allowingReadAccessToURL:`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/loadfilerequest(_:allowingreadaccessto:)): loads a file from the local file system with controlled read access using a `URLRequest`.

The `baseURL` parameter in the first two methods determines the effective origin of the loaded content:

- For `WKWebView`: setting `baseURL` to `nil` sets the effective origin to `"null"`, which is treated as an opaque origin and isn't considered the same as other origins under the same-origin policy.
- For `UIWebView` (DEPRECATED since iOS 12, don't use): setting `baseURL` to `nil` results in an effective origin with the `applewebdata://` scheme, which doesn't apply the same-origin policy in the same way and may allow the loaded content to access local files.

In contrast to Android, iOS enforces a per-load directory boundary through `allowingReadAccessTo`. When using `loadFileURL:allowingReadAccessToURL:` or `loadFileRequest:allowingReadAccessToURL:`, file access is primarily constrained by the `allowingReadAccessToURL` boundary combined with the app sandbox. In contrast, on Android, file access behavior is primarily controlled by WebView settings that modify how `file://` origins interact with other files and network resources, and there is no direct per load directory restriction equivalent to `allowingReadAccessToURL`.

If it points to a single file, only that file will be accessible. Example:

```swift
var fileURL = FileManager.default.urls(for: .libraryDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0]
fileURL = fileURL.appendingPathComponent("index.html")
wkWebView.loadFileURL(fileURL, allowingReadAccessTo: fileURL)
```

If it points to a directory, all files in that directory will be accessible to the WebView. Example:

```swift
var dirURL = FileManager.default.urls(for: .libraryDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)[0]
var fileURL = dirURL.appendingPathComponent("index.html")
wkWebView.loadFileURL(fileURL, allowingReadAccessTo: dirURL) // All files in dirURL are accessible
```

## WebView File Access

WebViews in iOS can be configured to allow access to local files using the `file://` URL scheme. The behavior and configurability differ between `UIWebView` and `WKWebView`.

### WKWebView File Access from File URLs

On iOS these are internal WebKit preferences and aren't public `WKWebView` APIs. Attempting to set them through key value coding is unsupported and may stop working across system versions.

Conceptually they influence how the web security model treats `file://` origins.

The following properties can be used to configure file access (both are undocumented and must be set via Key-Value Coding, i.e. by using `setValue:forKey:`):

- `allowFileAccessFromFileURLs` ([`WKPreferences`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkpreferences), `false` by default): enables JavaScript running in the context of a `file://` scheme URL to access content from other `file://` scheme URLs.
- `allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` ([`WKWebViewConfiguration`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebviewconfiguration), `false` by default): enables JavaScript running in the context of a `file://` scheme URL to access content from any origin.

`allowingReadAccessTo` and the undocumented `allowFileAccessFromFileURLs` and `allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` don't govern the same scope. `allowingReadAccessTo` affects direct local document loading by the WebView, whereas the undocumented preferences affect whether JavaScript running in a `file://` origin can access additional local or cross-origin resources. That's why, even if `loadFileURL(_:allowingReadAccessTo:)` is restricted to a single file or directory, enabling these unsupported preferences can allow `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest` to reach local files that wouldn't be reachable through direct HTML embedding or `iframe` navigation alone.

### UIWebView File Access (DEPRECATED since iOS 12, don't use)

`UIWebView` has both `allowFileAccessFromFileURLs` and `allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` enabled by default and doesn't offer an option to disable them. This makes `UIWebView` inherently insecure for loading local content, especially if JavaScript is enabled (which can't be disabled in `UIWebView`).

## Notes on Exploitation

Broad file read access alone doesn't expose data. Exploitation generally requires several factors. The attacker must be able to execute JavaScript in the `WKWebView`, for example through injected HTML, attacker-controlled pages loaded by the app, deep links that open untrusted content in a WebView, or exposed JavaScript bridges.

If these conditions are met, enabling the undocumented `allowFileAccessFromFileURLs` preference can allow JavaScript running in a `file://` context to read additional local files using mechanisms such as `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`. This scope is distinct from the direct document loading scope controlled by `loadFileURL(_:allowingReadAccessTo:)` where access remains limited to locations the app can read, such as its sandboxed files.

Once data is accessible to JavaScript, exfiltration usually relies on standard WebView networking capabilities. A common mechanism is sending the data to an attacker-controlled server using web APIs such as `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`. For this to work across origins, the WebView must also permit such requests, for example through the undocumented `allowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs` preference, and the destination server must allow the cross-origin request, for example by returning appropriate CORS headers such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.

## WebView-Native Bridges

iOS WebViews provide a means of communication between the WebView and the native Swift or Objective-C code. Any important data or native functionality exposed to the WebView JavaScript engine would also be accessible to rogue JavaScript running in the WebView.

### WKWebView

JavaScript code in a `WKWebView` can send messages back to the native app. This communication is implemented using a messaging system and using the `postMessage` function, which automatically serializes JavaScript objects into native Objective-C or Swift objects. Message handlers are configured using the method [`add(_ scriptMessageHandler:name:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkusercontentcontroller/add(_:name:)).

### UIWebView (DEPRECATED since iOS 12, don't use)

There are two fundamental ways of how native code and JavaScript can communicate:

- **JSContext**: When an Objective-C or Swift block is assigned to an identifier in a `JSContext`, JavaScriptCore automatically wraps the block in a JavaScript function.
- **JSExport protocol**: Properties, instance methods and class methods declared in a `JSExport`-inherited protocol are mapped to JavaScript objects that are available to all JavaScript code. Modifications of objects that are in the JavaScript environment are reflected in the native environment.

Note that only class members defined in the `JSExport` protocol are made accessible to JavaScript code.

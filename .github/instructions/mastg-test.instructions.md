A MASWE weakness can have one or more platform-specific tests associated with it.

Tests have an [overview](#overview) and contain [Steps](#steps) which produce outputs called [observations](#observation) which must be [evaluated](#evaluation).

Tests must be located under `tests-beta/android/` or `tests-beta/ios/`, within the corresponding MASVS category. Their file names are the test IDs.

Example structure:

```sh
% ls -1 -F tests-beta/android/MASVS-CRYPTO/
MASTG-TEST-0204.md
MASTG-TEST-0205.md
```

Example tests for reference:

- [@MASTG-TEST-0207](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/tests/android/MASVS-STORAGE/MASTG-TEST-0207/)
- [@MASTG-TEST-0216](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/tests/android/MASVS-STORAGE/MASTG-TEST-0216/)
- [@MASTG-TEST-0263](https://mas.owasp.org/MASTG/tests/android/MASVS-RESILIENCE/MASTG-TEST-0263/)

Notes:

- Tests with `platform: network` are still organized under the OS folder that the MASVS category belongs to (for example, Android network tests live under `tests-beta/android/MASVS-NETWORK/`).
- Old tests under `tests/` don't follow these new guidelines. We are currently working to deprecate all of them in favor of these new approach.

## Keeping Android and iOS Tests Aligned

When a weakness has tests on both platforms, the Android and iOS tests **must be kept aligned**. They should share the same `title` and, as far as possible, the same body structure and wording. The goal is that a reader comparing the two platforms sees the same test, differing only where the platform genuinely forces it.

What must match across platforms:

- **`title`**: identical on both platforms (don't include "Android" or "iOS" in the title; see [title](#title)).
- **`weakness`**: the same `MASWE-XXXX` id.
- **MASVS category and folder**: the same category (for example, both under `MASVS-RESILIENCE/`). A single weakness must not be split across different categories on different platforms.
- **`profiles`**: the same profile set.
- **Optional metadata that expresses the same intent**: if one platform sets `false_negative_prone`, `best-practices`, or `apis`, the other should too (with its platform-specific values).
- **Body structure**: the same sections, the same issue framing in the Overview, parallel Example Attack Scenarios, and the same Observation/Evaluation logic (including any `**Further Validation Required:**` and `**Expected False Negatives:**` blocks).

What is allowed to differ (only because the platform forces it):

- **APIs and class names** (for example, `CCHmac`/`SecKeyCreateSignature` on iOS vs. `javax.crypto.Mac`/`java.security.Signature` on Android).
- **Storage and platform mechanisms** (for example, `UserDefaults`/`NSUserDefaults` vs. `SharedPreferences`; jailbroken vs. rooted).
- **`knowledge` and `best-practices` pages**: each platform links its own.
- **TECH IDs in Steps and `**Further Validation Required:**` blocks**: use the canonical per-platform technique (see [Preferred TECH IDs by Platform and Test Type](#preferred-tech-ids-by-platform-and-test-type)).
- **Demos and tooling**: the underlying analysis tool may differ (for example, r2/disassembly on iOS vs. semgrep on Android). Keep demo structure parallel where practical.

When you create or modify a test that has a counterpart on the other platform, update both so they stay in sync. If you intentionally diverge beyond the platform-forced differences above, that divergence must be justified and discussed with the team.

Each test has two parts: the [Markdown metadata](#markdown-metadata) (YAML `front matter`) and the [Markdown body](#markdown-body).

## Creating Test IDs

When creating a new test (whether porting from v1 or writing from scratch), use a **fake ID** starting at `MASTG-TEST-0x01` and incrementing within the PR (e.g., `MASTG-TEST-0x01`, `MASTG-TEST-0x02`, `MASTG-TEST-0x03`). This prevents conflicts between parallel pull requests.

Once your pull request is reviewed and ready to merge, the team will assign real IDs (for example, `MASTG-TEST-0233`) before the content is published.

## Markdown: Metadata

### title

Test titles should be concise and clearly state the purpose of the test.

In some cases, the test name and the weakness may have the same title, but typically, tests cover different aspects of a weakness. Titles should reflect that.

Avoid including Android or iOS unless necessary, as in "Insecure use of the Android Protected Confirmation API".

Follow a consistent style across all test titles.

#### Conventions

- Static: "References to…" (semgrep/r2)
- Dynamic: "Runtime Use …" (frida/frooky)

Exceptions may apply where "Runtime ..." feels forced, for example, tests using adb, local backups, or filesystem snapshots.

### platform

The mobile platform. One of the following:

- `android`
- `ios`
- `network`: for platform-agnostic traffic analysis tests where the checks are performed purely on captured/observed traffic (often paired with `type: [dynamic, network]`).

### id

The test ID.

### weakness

The MASWE weakness ID associated with this test.

- In YAML front matter, specify the bare identifier (for example, `weakness: MASWE-0069`). In body text, include the leading `@` (for example, @MASWE-0069).

### type

One or more test types.

Supported:

- `static`: base type for analysis that doesn't require app execution. Always combined with `code`, `config`, or `package` to indicate the specific kind of static analysis performed.
- `code`: code-level analysis via decompilation or disassembly of the app binary, reverse-engineered source code, or developer artifacts. Always combined with `static` (e.g., `type: [static, code]`).
- `config`: static analysis of configuration files within the app package (e.g., AndroidManifest, Network Security Configuration, Info.plist, App Transport Security settings). Always combined with `static` (e.g., `type: [static, config]`).
- `package`: static inspection of specific binary files or resources within the app package (e.g., native libraries, XML resource files). Always combined with `static` (e.g., `type: [static, package]`).
- `dynamic`: base type for analysis that requires the app to be running. Always combined with `hooks`, `logs`, `filesystem`, or `network` to indicate the specific kind of runtime analysis performed.
- `hooks`: runtime method interception or instrumentation at the API level (for example, via Frida). Always combined with `dynamic` (e.g., `type: [dynamic, hooks]`).
- `logs`: observation of platform-level log output produced by the app or the system (for example, via adb logcat or `os_log`). Always combined with `dynamic` (e.g., `type: [dynamic, logs]`).
- `manual`: manual steps that require human judgment, such as inspecting app behavior, UI, or configuration. This may include reverse engineering or runtime analysis that can't be fully automated. Any test that includes a `**Further Validation Required:**` block MUST include `manual` in its `type` array (e.g., `[static, manual]`, `[dynamic, manual]`).
- `network`: analysis of network traffic captured from the running app, for example via a proxy or network capture tool. Always combined with `dynamic` (e.g., `type: [dynamic, network]`).
- `filesystem`: analysis of the app's file system, including local storage or backups. Always combined with `dynamic` (e.g., `type: [dynamic, filesystem]`).
- `developer`: tests only the developer can perform because they require access to the source code, build process, or other internal resources.

Example:

```md
type: [static, code]
```

Examples with multiple types:

```md
type: [dynamic, hooks, manual]
```

### best-practices

Reference platform-specific mitigations or best practices. Automation generates a "Mitigations" section.

Reference the related `best-practices/` pages for background using their ID. Create the pages if they don't exist yet.

Example:

```md
best-practices: [MASTG-BEST-0001]
```

### prerequisites

List the conditions that must be known or available before running or evaluating the test. These items capture internal context that only the developer or the organization can provide. Existing files are in the `prerequisites/` folder. Create new ones when needed.

Common examples include:

- Defined categories of sensitive data and their sensitivity levels used within the app.
- A list of first party packages, libraries, and modules.
- A list of first party network domains and services the app is expected to contact.

If there are no prerequisites, you can omit this field or use an empty list.

Example:

```md
prerequisites:
- identify-sensitive-data
- identify-security-relevant-contexts
```

### profiles

Specify the MAS profiles to which the test applies. Valid values: L1, L2, P, R.
The profiles are described in [MAS Testing Profiles Guide](../../Document/0x03b-Testing-Profiles.md)

- L1 denotes Essential Security.
- L2 denotes Advanced Security.
- P denotes Privacy.
- R denotes Resilience.

Example:

```md
profiles: [L1, L2, P]
```

### knowledge

Must always reference related `knowledge/` pages for background using their ID. Create the pages if they don't exist yet.

Example:

```md
knowledge: [MASTG-KNOW-0013]
```

### optional fields

Include these if relevant:

- `status:` draft, placeholder, deprecated
- `note:` short free-form note
- `available_since:` minimum platform/API level (e.g. 13 in Android or 2.0 in iOS)
- `deprecated_since:` last applicable platform/API level (e.g. 24 in Android or 12.0 in iOS)
- `apis:` list of relevant APIs

Notes:

- For Android, available/deprecated API levels are integers (for example, `deprecated_since: 24`). For iOS, use the iOS release version (for example, `available_since: 13`).

## Markdown: Body

### Overview

The overview is platform-specific and extends the weakness overview with details on the area tested (the Knowledge items from the `knowledge` in the metadata).

Very important: the overview must be phrased like an issue.

- Describe the relevant platform feature/API from the perspective of "what can go wrong" (risk, failure mode, exposure).
- Make it clear why the test exists: what the tester is trying to detect and why that matters.

Don't repeat the weakness description here. Focus on the specific issue the test is checking for on the given platform.

Good patterns for issue framing:

- "If the app uses/implements/configures X, Y can happen …"
- "This can lead to … (exposure, bypass, integrity failure, privacy leak) …"
- "This test checks/verifies whether the app …"

Don't write the overview like a neutral platform description. Neutral/descriptive explanations belong in `knowledge/`.

Example:

```md
## Overview

Android apps sometimes use insecure pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) such as `java.util.Random`, which is essentially a linear congruential generator. This type of PRNG generates a predictable sequence of numbers for any given seed value, making the sequence reproducible and insecure for cryptographic use. In particular, `java.util.Random` and `Math.random()` ([the latter](https://franklinta.com/2014/08/31/predicting-the-next-math-random-in-java/) simply calling `nextDouble()` on a static `java.util.Random` instance) produce identical number sequences when initialized with the same seed across all Java implementations.
```

### Steps

A test must include at least one step. Steps can be static, dynamic, manual, or, in very specific cases, a combination of these.

- Don't reference MASTG tools directly. Always link to existing MASTG-TECH by ID (for example, @MASTG-TECH-0014)
- When a MASTG-TECH exists, always start step instructions with `Use @MASTG-TECH-XXXX to ...`. Avoid `Run`, `Execute`, or parenthetical-only references such as `(@MASTG-TECH-XXXX)` as the primary action.
- Use "reverse engineer" (non-hyphenated) when referring to the process (e.g. "to reverse engineer an app") and "reverse-engineered" (hyphenated) when referring to the code (e.g. "reverse-engineered code").
- Be consistent by preferring to use canonical steps from the sections below. Don't create new phrasing or wording when it's not necessary.

Example:

```md
## Steps

1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0014 to look for the relevant APIs.
```

#### Canonical Step Templates by Test Type

The combination of `type` and `platform` uniquely identifies the canonical template a test must follow:

| type | platform | canonical template |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[static, code]` | android, ios | Static Analysis - Code Inspection |
| `[static, config]` | android, ios | Static Analysis - Configuration and Manifest Inspection |
| `[static, package]` | android, ios | Static Analysis - App Package Content Inspection |
| `[static, developer]` | android, ios | Static Analysis - Developer Artifacts |
| `[dynamic, hooks]` | android, ios | Dynamic Analysis - Hooking |
| `[dynamic, logs]` | android, ios | Dynamic Analysis - Log Monitoring |
| `[dynamic, filesystem]` | android, ios | Dynamic Analysis - Filesystem |
| `[dynamic, network]` | android, ios | Dynamic Analysis - Network Monitoring |

Each combination has a **required step pattern**. Use these as the base and add further steps only when the test genuinely requires more detail (e.g., extra navigation steps, filtering instructions, or additional manual actions).

##### Static Analysis - Code Inspection

Use when the test analyzes the app's code via decompilation or disassembly to detect insecure API usage or implementation issues.

**`type: [static, code]` — Android**

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0013 to reverse engineer the app.

**`type: [static, package]` — Android**

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0007 to extract [the relevant files] from the app package.
```

**`type: [static, package]` — iOS**

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0058 to extract [the relevant files] from the app package.
```

##### Static Analysis - Native Libraries

Use when the test requires analysis of native libraries included in the app package (for example, checking for the presence of security features in native code).

**`type: [static, package]` — Android**

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0157 to extract the native libraries from the app package.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0115 on each native library to obtain the compiler-provided security features.

2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0118 on the main binary and each shared library to obtain all relevant artifacts related to the compiler-provided security features.
```

##### Static Analysis - Developer Artifacts

Use when the test requires access to the source code, build system, or other developer resources not available in the distributed app package (for example, generating an SBOM from the build).

**`type: [static, developer]` — Android**

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0130 to generate a SBOM, or request one in CycloneDX format from the development team.
```

**`type: [static, developer]` — iOS**

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0132 to generate a SBOM, or request one in CycloneDX format from the development team.
```

##### Static + Dynamic Analysis

**`type: [static, dynamic]` — Android, iOS**

This is currently not allowed (with a few exceptions). Please use separate static and dynamic tests. If you think a combined test is necessary, please discuss it with the team.

##### Dynamic Analysis - Hooking

Use when the test hooks, intercepts or modifies API call behavior at runtime.

**`type: [dynamic, hooks]` — Android**

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0005 to install the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0043 to hook the relevant API calls.
3. Exercise the app extensively to trigger as many flows as possible and enter sensitive data wherever you can.
```

**`type: [dynamic, hooks]` — iOS**

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0056 to install the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0095 to hook the relevant APIs.
3. Exercise the app extensively to trigger as many flows as possible and enter sensitive data wherever you can.
```

##### Dynamic Analysis - Network Monitoring

Use when the test captures and inspects network traffic generated by the running app to detect insecure communication patterns.

**`type: [dynamic, network]` — Android**

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0005 to install the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0010 to capture the app traffic.
3. Exercise the app extensively to trigger as many flows as possible and enter sensitive data wherever you can.
```

**`type: [dynamic, network]` — iOS**

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0056 to install the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0062 to capture the app traffic.
3. Exercise the app extensively to trigger as many flows as possible and enter sensitive data wherever you can.
```

##### Dynamic Analysis - Filesystem

Use when the test inspects files created, modified, or stored by the running app on the device file system.

**`type: [dynamic, filesystem]` — Android (filesystem snapshot/diff pattern)**

Use when the test identifies files created or modified by the app by comparing the device storage before and after exercising the app.

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0005 to install the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0002 to get a baseline list of files.
3. Exercise the app extensively to trigger as many flows as possible and enter sensitive data wherever you can.
4. Use @MASTG-TECH-0002 to retrieve the list of files again.
5. Calculate the difference between the two lists.
```

If only retrieval is needed (for example, to check the files in external storage), you can omit the baseline retrieval and the diff step.

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0005 to install the app.
2. Exercise the app extensively to trigger as many flows as possible and enter sensitive data wherever you can.
3. Use @MASTG-TECH-0002 to retrieve the list of files in the external storage.
```

**`type: [dynamic, filesystem]` — iOS (filesystem snapshot/diff pattern)**

Use when the test identifies files created or modified by the app by comparing the device storage before and after exercising the app.

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0056 to install the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0059 to get a baseline list of files.
3. Exercise the app extensively to trigger as many flows as possible and enter sensitive data wherever you can.
4. Use @MASTG-TECH-0059 to retrieve the list of files again.
5. Calculate the difference between the two lists.
```

If only one retrieval is needed (for example, to check the data protection classes of files in private storage), you can omit the baseline retrieval and the diff step.

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0056 to install the app.
3. Exercise the app extensively to trigger as many flows as possible and enter sensitive data wherever you can.
3. Use @MASTG-TECH-0059 to retrieve the list of files including their data protection classes.
```

##### Dynamic Analysis - Log Monitoring

Use when the test monitors log output generated by the running app or the platform to detect sensitive data leakage or unexpected behavior.

**`type: [dynamic, logs]` — Android**

Use when the test observes system-level log entries produced by the app or the platform (for example, StrictMode output).

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0005 to install the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0009 to monitor the system logs.
```

**`type: [dynamic, logs]` — iOS**

Use when the test monitors device-level log output (for example, `os_log` entries).

```md
1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0056 to install the app.
2. Use @MASTG-TECH-0060 to monitor the device logs.
```

**Key rules:**

- All tests with `dynamic` in their `type` array **MUST** start with an install step:
    - Android: `1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0005 to install the app.`
    - iOS: `1. Use @MASTG-TECH-0056 to install the app.`
- For `[dynamic, hooks]` tests, use @MASTG-TECH-0043/@MASTG-TECH-0095 for intercepting or modifying API behavior; use @MASTG-TECH-0033 only for passive observation and logging of API calls.
- Step descriptions are intentionally vague e.g. `to look for uses of the relevant APIs`. This is to allow for ease reuse across tests and easy refactoring whenever needed in the future. The specific APIs to look for are determined by the test's metadata `apis` field (even if it's currently optional) and the test overview, and should be clear to the tester without needing to be explicitly stated in the step instructions.

### Observation

The output you get after executing all steps. It serves as evidence.

It MUST start with "The output should contain ...".

Example:

```md
## Observation

The output should contain a list of locations where insecure random APIs are used.
```

### Evaluation

Using the observation as input, describe how to evaluate it. State explicitly what makes the test fail.

It MUST start with "The test case fails if ...".

Example:

```md
## Evaluation

The test case fails if you can find random numbers generated using those APIs that are used in security-relevant contexts.
```

An explanation of the conditions that make the test pass must not be added. It is always assumed that the test fails for certain conditions and passes otherwise, making the pass explanation redundant.

A pass explanation can only be added for rare edge cases where it is unavoidable due to conditions particular to that case.

In that case, it MUST start with "The test case passes if ..." and must be added after the fail explanation.

IMPORTANT: Don't include remediation advice or best practices in the evaluation section. Remediation belongs in `best-practices/` and must be linked in the test metadata `best-practices`. If it doesn't exist yet, create it.

#### Further Validation Required

When automated tools alone can't confirm whether the fail condition is met, add a `**Further Validation Required:**` block immediately after the fail condition sentence. Use it in exactly two situations:

1. **Security-relevance is context-dependent**: the tool finds uses of an API but can't determine whether the usage is security-relevant (for example, insecure random APIs may be used for non-security purposes such as UI animations or game mechanics).
2. **Implementation correctness requires code inspection**: the tool finds a code pattern (for example, a custom `TrustManager`) but can't confirm whether the implementation is actually incorrect — a human must read the code to determine which failure case applies.

Do NOT add this block when the fail condition is self-evident from the observation alone (for example, a known-dangerous flag is set, or a specific insecure API is called with a hardcoded bad argument).

The block MUST appear immediately after the "The test case fails if ..." sentence (and its optional case list). Choose the phrasing based on the test type and what the observation provides:

**`type: [static, manual]` — code location inspection:**

When the observation contains code locations from static analysis tools:

```md
The test case fails if [condition].

**Further Validation Required:**

Inspect each reported code location using @MASTG-TECH-XXXX to determine whether [reason]:

- Determine whether ...
```

```md
The test case fails if [condition].

**Further Validation Required:**

Inspect each reported code location using @MASTG-TECH-XXXX, looking for cases such as:

- **Case name:** ...
```

Use the first phrasing when confirming security-relevance; use the second when confirming an incorrect implementation (for example, "looking for cases such as: trust manager that does nothing").

**`type: [dynamic, manual]` — hook output with backtraces (code inspection):**

When the observation comes from runtime hooks (@MASTG-TECH-0043 or @MASTG-TECH-0095) and includes backtraces:

```md
The test case fails if [condition].

**Further Validation Required:**

Using the backtraces from the hook output, inspect the code locations using @MASTG-TECH-XXXX to determine whether [reason]:

- Determine whether ...
```

Or, when listing multiple things to inspect without a single inline reason:

```md
The test case fails if [condition].

**Further Validation Required:**

Using the backtraces from the hook output, inspect the code locations using @MASTG-TECH-XXXX:

- Determine whether ...
- Determine whether ...
```

**`type: [dynamic, filesystem, manual]` — filesystem output (file content inspection):**

When the observation is a list of files (from a filesystem snapshot diff or file hooks), not code locations:

```md
The test case fails if [condition].

**Further Validation Required:**

Inspect the content of each reported file to determine whether the data is sensitive:

- Determine whether the file contains sensitive information (e.g., personal data, credentials, or tokens).
- Determine whether the data is stored without encryption.
```

**`type: [dynamic, manual]` — visual output (screenshot inspection):**

When the observation is a collection of screenshots:

```md
The test case fails if [condition].

**Further Validation Required:**

Inspect each screenshot visually, looking for sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, personally identifiable information, or other sensitive content that should not be exposed.
```

**Requirement:** Any test with a `**Further Validation Required:**` block MUST include `manual` in its `type` array, in addition to its other types (for example, `type: [static, manual]`).

#### Expected False Negatives

When a test has known technical limitations that may cause it to miss certain findings, add an `**Expected False Negatives:**` block at the very end of the Evaluation section, after any `**Further Validation Required:**` block and any admonition notes.

Use this block to explain:

- Which specific implementation patterns or technical conditions may prevent the test from detecting the issue (for example, custom UI frameworks, native code, obfuscation, or dynamic loading).
- What additional steps a tester may take to compensate (for example, manual reverse engineering or custom instrumentation).

Do NOT use this block for general test coverage limitations. Reserve it for specific, identifiable technical conditions that are known to cause false negatives for this particular test.

Example:

```md
**Expected False Negatives:**

This test may produce false negatives if the app uses custom text input controls that do not rely on standard UIKit classes such as `UITextField` or `UITextView` (for example, in custom UI frameworks or game engines), or if text entry is handled through nonstandard abstractions that prevent reliable observation of input traits at runtime.
```

Example:

```md
**Expected False Negatives:**

This test may produce false negatives if the app uses root detection techniques that are not covered by the hooks or traces used in this test, or if the root detection logic is implemented in a way that evades detection (for example, through obfuscation, dynamic code loading, or anti-instrumentation techniques). In such cases, the absence of findings does not guarantee the absence of root detection, and additional manual reverse engineering or custom instrumentation may be required to identify and analyze root detection mechanisms.
```

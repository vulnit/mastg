Authoring standards for the Knowledge articles under `knowledge/`.

Knowledge pages explain Android or iOS features and concepts that tests and techniques rely on.

Scope boundaries (this is important for consistency across the project):

- Knowledge (MASTG-KNOW) is descriptive: what the thing is, what it does, how it works, and what APIs/configuration knobs exist.
- Tests (MASTG-TEST) are issue-focused: what can go wrong with that thing in apps, and how to detect it.
- Best Practices (MASTG-BEST) are prescriptive: how to prevent or fix the issues that tests look for.

Because of this separation, don't include "what can go wrong", threat scenarios, failure criteria, or remediation advice in Knowledge pages.

Avoid language and structures that imply security testing or remediation, for example:

- "attackers can …", "this is insecure …", "this is vulnerable …"
- "the test fails if …", "to prevent this …", "you should/shouldn't …"

Locations and taxonomy:

- `knowledge/android/MASVS-<CATEGORY>/MASTG-KNOW-####.md`
- `knowledge/ios/MASVS-<CATEGORY>/MASTG-KNOW-####.md`
- `knowledge/index.md` is the catalog landing page.

`<CATEGORY>` is one of: `AUTH`, `CODE`, `CRYPTO`, `NETWORK`, `PLATFORM`, `PRIVACY`, `RESILIENCE`, `STORAGE`.

File naming and IDs:

- The file name defines the knowledge ID: `MASTG-KNOW-\d{4}.md`.
- Don't add an `id:` field to the YAML front matter.
- Place the file in the platform (`android` or `ios`) and MASVS category folder that best matches the subject.

When creating a new knowledge page (whether during porting or writing from scratch), use a **fake ID** starting at `MASTG-KNOW-0x01` and incrementing within the PR (e.g., `MASTG-KNOW-0x01`, `MASTG-KNOW-0x02`, `MASTG-KNOW-0x03`). This prevents conflicts between parallel pull requests.

Once your pull request is reviewed and ready to merge, the team will assign real IDs (for example, `MASTG-KNOW-0112`) before the content is published.

Follow the global Markdown rules (see `.github/instructions/markdown.instructions.md`). Use `##` and `###` headings in the body.

## Markdown: Metadata

Include a YAML front matter block with these fields.

Required:

- `masvs_category:` One of: `MASVS-AUTH`, `MASVS-CODE`, `MASVS-CRYPTO`, `MASVS-NETWORK`, `MASVS-PLATFORM`, `MASVS-PRIVACY`, `MASVS-RESILIENCE`, `MASVS-STORAGE`.
- `platform:` One of: `android`, `ios`.
- `title:` Clear and specific concept title (for example, "Android KeyStore").

Optional:

- `best-practices:` Reference platform-specific mitigations or best practices from `best-practices/`, when relevant.
- `status:` `placeholder`, or `deprecated`.
- `available_since:` Minimum platform/API level (Android: integer API level; iOS: release version, for example `13`).
- `deprecated_since:` Last applicable platform/API level.

Examples:

```yaml
---
masvs_category: MASVS-STORAGE
platform: android
title: Android KeyStore
available_since: 18
---
```

## Markdown: Body

Keep content authoritative, concise, and platform-focused. Avoid duplicating OS documentation. Instead, cite it and summarize the feature, including its purpose and functionality.

Considerations for writing the content:

- Define the concept and its scope. Relate to OS components, APIs, or security model elements.
- Explain behavior and implications that are relevant to security testing without framing them as "risks" or "attacks". (Tests cover "what can go wrong"; Best Practices cover "what to do about it".)
- Include specific API names, version nuances, storage locations, and configuration knobs. Try to avoid code samples. Instead, refer to the existing MASTG-DEMO code files. If you include them, keep them short and explanatory.
- Use references from official docs and standards. Avoid non-authoritative sources.
- In body text, reference internal MAS identifiers with a leading `@` (for example, @MASTG-KNOW-0001, @MASTG-TEST-0204, @MASTG-TECH-0014, @MASTG-TOOL-0031, @MASWE-0089).

## Writing conventions

- Use American spelling, second person, and active voice.
- Prefer short paragraphs and bullet lists for scannability.
- Use HTML `<img>` for images as per the markdown instructions.

## Edge cases and guidance

- Cross-category content: If a topic spans two MASVS categories, choose the best fit and reference the other in the body; avoid duplicate pages.
- Generic vs platform: Concepts that are identical across platforms should be split into platform folders if platform detail matters; otherwise, place details where they differ and keep overviews succinct.
- Where to place recommendations: Keep all prescriptive advice (do/don't, secure configuration values, mitigations) in Best Practices pages under `best-practices/`, and link them from the "Related" section.
- When writing tests, techniques, or tools, always try to link to a Knowledge article (and create one if it's missing). Tests should also link to Knowledge by using the `@MASTG-KNOW-xxxx` notation to make the relationship explicit.

## Deprecation

If the source is gone, not relevant anymore, or too old, set the following in the YAML front matter:

- `status:` Must be set to `deprecated`
- `deprecation_note:` Short clarifying note for deprecation. Keep phrasing concise and imperative
- `covered_by:` List of MASTG-TOOL-xxxx tools covering for this one, if any.

**Example:**

```yaml
---
masvs_category: MASVS-AUTH
platform: android
title: FingerprintManager
deprecated_since: 28
available_since: 23
status: deprecated
deprecation_note: "The FingerprintManager class is deprecated in Android 9 (API level 28) and should not be used for new applications. Instead, use the BiometricPrompt API or the Biometric library for Android."
covered_by: [MASTG-KNOW-0001]
---
```

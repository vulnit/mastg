Frida is a free and open source dynamic code instrumentation toolkit written by Ole André Vadla Ravnås that works by injecting the [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) JavaScript engine (previously [Duktape](https://duktape.org/ "Duktape JavaScript Engine") and [V8](https://v8.dev/docs "V8 JavaScript Engine")) into the instrumented process. Frida lets you execute snippets of JavaScript into native apps on Android and iOS (as well as on [other platforms](https://www.frida.re/docs/home/ "So what is Frida, exactly?")).

## Installation

To install Frida locally, simply run:

```bash
pip install frida-tools
```

Or refer to the [installation page](https://www.frida.re/docs/installation/ "Frida Installation") for more details.

## Modes of Operation

Code can be injected in several ways. For example, @MASTG-TOOL-0149 permanently modifies the Android app loader, providing hooks for running your own code every time a new process is started.
In contrast, Frida implements code injection by writing code directly into the process memory. When attached to a running app:

- Frida uses ptrace to hijack a thread of a running process. This thread is used to allocate a chunk of memory and populate it with a mini-bootstrapper.
- The bootstrapper starts a fresh thread, connects to the Frida debugging server that's running on the device, and loads a shared library that contains the Frida agent (`frida-agent.so`).
- The agent establishes a bi-directional communication channel back to the tool (e.g. the Frida REPL or your custom Python script).
- The hijacked thread resumes after being restored to its original state, and process execution continues as usual.

Frida offers three modes of operation:

1. Injected: this is the most common scenario when frida-server is running as a daemon in the iOS or Android device. frida-core is exposed over TCP, listening on localhost:27042 by default. Running in this mode isn't possible on devices that aren't rooted or jailbroken.
2. Embedded: this is the case when your device isn't rooted nor jailbroken (you can't use ptrace as an unprivileged user), you're responsible for the injection of the [frida-gadget](https://www.frida.re/docs/gadget/ "Frida Gadget") library by embedding it into your app, manually or via third-party tools such as @MASTG-TOOL-0038.
3. Preloaded: similar to `LD_PRELOAD` or `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`. You can configure the frida-gadget to run autonomously and load a script from the filesystem (e.g. path relative to where the Gadget binary resides).

## APIs

Independently of the chosen mode, you can make use of the [Frida JavaScript APIs](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/ "Frida JavaScript APIs") to interact with the running process and its memory. Some of the fundamental APIs are:

- [Interceptor](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#interceptor "Interceptor"): When using the Interceptor API, Frida injects a trampoline (aka in-line hooking) at the function prologue which provokes a redirection to our custom code, executes our code, and returns to the original function. Note that while very effective for our purpose, this introduces a considerable overhead (due to the trampoline related jumping and context switching) and can't be considered transparent as it overwrites the original code and acts similar to a debugger (putting breakpoints) and therefore can be detected in a similar manner, e.g. by applications that periodically checksum their own code.
- [Stalker](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#stalker "Stalker"): If your tracing requirements include transparency, performance and high granularity, Stalker should be your API of choice. When tracing code with the Stalker API, Frida leverages just-in-time dynamic recompilation (by using [Capstone](https://www.capstone-engine.org/ "Capstone")): when a thread is about to execute its next instructions, Stalker allocates some memory, copies the original code over, and interlaces the copy with your custom code for instrumentation. Finally, it executes the copy (leaving the original code untouched, and therefore avoiding any anti-debugging checks). This approach increases instrumentation performance considerably and allows for very high granularity when tracing (e.g. by tracing exclusively CALL or RET instructions). You can learn more in-depth details in [the blog post "Anatomy of a code tracer" by Frida's creator Ole](https://medium.com/@oleavr/anatomy-of-a-code-tracer-b081aadb0df8 "Anatomy of a code tracer") [#vadla]. Some examples of use for Stalker are, for example [who-does-it-call](https://codeshare.frida.re/@oleavr/who-does-it-call/ "who-does-it-call") or [diff-calls](https://github.com/frida/frida-presentations/blob/master/R2Con2017/01-basics/02-diff-calls.js "diff-calls"). For practical tutorials and advanced usage patterns, see the [Stalker section in the Frida Handbook](https://learnfrida.info/advanced_usage/#stalker).
- [Java](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#java "Java"): When working on Android you can use this API to enumerate loaded classes, enumerate class loaders, create and use specific class instances, enumerate live instances of classes by scanning the heap, etc.
- [ObjC](https://www.frida.re/docs/javascript-api/#objc "ObjC"): When working on iOS you can use this API to get a mapping of all registered classes, register or use specific class or protocol instances, enumerate live instances of classes by scanning the heap, etc.

### Frida 17

Frida 17 introduces [breaking changes](https://frida.re/news/2025/05/17/frida-17-0-0-released/), such as the removal of the bundled runtime bridges as well as changes to several native APIs.

**Bridges:**

Frida 17 removes the bundled [runtime bridges](https://frida.re/docs/bridges/) (`frida-{objc,swift,java}-bridge`) within Frida's GumJS runtime. When you use CLI tools such as `frida`, `frida-trace` or @MASTG-TOOL-0145, this doesn't have any noticeable impact, as they come with the Java, Objective-C, and Swift bridges pre-bundled, so you can still use them as before.

However, if you're writing your own custom Frida-based tooling or scripts that depend on these bridges, you'll now need to install them separately via `frida-pm`, Frida's package manager. For example, to install the Java bridge, run:

```bash
frida-pm install frida-java-bridge
```

And then, in your scripts, you can import and use the bridge as follows:

```js
import JavaBridge from 'frida-java-bridge';
JavaBridge.load();
```

You'll need to use `frida-compile` to bundle your scripts with the required bridges before running them with Frida from your own tooling (e.g. from a custom Python script):

```bash
npx frida-compile -o agent.js -o _agent.js
```

**API Changes:**

Frida has made changes to its native APIs. While these changes may break some of your existing scripts, they encourage you to write more readable and performant code. See a full overview in the [MASTG Frida scripts writing guide](https://mas.owasp.org/contributing/writing-content/mastg-frida-scripts.instructions#use-and-validation-of-frida-apis).

For instance, now, `Process.enumerateModules()` returns an array of `Module` objects, allowing you to work with them directly.

```js
for (const module of Process.enumerateModules()) {
  console.log(module.name);
}
```

Another API that was removed is `Module.getSymbolByName`, which is used in many scripts. Depending on if you know which module the symbol is located in or not, you can use one of the following two alternatives:

```js
// If you know the module
Process.getModuleByName('libc.so').getExportByName('open')

// If you don't (i.e., the old Module.getSymbolByName(null, 'open'); )
Module.getGlobalExportByName('open');
```

For more details, see:

- the [Frida 17.0.0 Release Notes](https://frida.re/news/2025/05/17/frida-17-0-0-released/)
- the [updated Frida JavaScript API documentation](https://frida.re/docs/javascript-api/)
- the [frida-gum typings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/refs/heads/master/types/frida-gum/index.d.ts)

## Tools

Frida also provides a couple of simple tools built on top of the Frida API and available right from your terminal after installing frida-tools via pip. For instance:

- [`frida`](https://www.frida.re/docs/frida-cli/ "Frida CLI"): Frida CLI for quick script prototyping and try/error scenarios.
- [`frida-ps`](https://www.frida.re/docs/frida-ps/ "frida-ps"): lists all processes (apps) running on the device, including their names, identifiers, and PIDs.
- [`frida-ls-devices`](https://www.frida.re/docs/frida-ls-devices/ "frida-ls-devices"): lists your connected devices running Frida servers or agents.
- [`frida-trace`](https://www.frida.re/docs/frida-trace/ "frida-trace"): traces function calls without writing Frida scripts.

In addition, you'll also find several open source Frida-based tools, such as:

- @MASTG-TOOL-0061: a Runtime Application Instrument toolkig for iOS.
- @MASTG-TOOL-0106: a memory dumping tool for both Android and iOS.
- @MASTG-TOOL-0038: a runtime mobile security assessment framework.
- @MASTG-TOOL-0036: a project merging the powerful reverse engineering capabilities of radare2 with the dynamic instrumentation toolkit of Frida.
- @MASTG-TOOL-0107: a tool for tracing usage of the Android JNI runtime methods by a native library.

We will be using all of these tools throughout the guide.

You can use these tools as-is, tweak them to your needs, or take as excellent examples on how to use the APIs. Having them as an example is very helpful when you write your own hooking scripts or when you build introspection tools to support your reverse engineering workflow.

RootBeer is an Android library for detecting root access on devices. It implements multiple detection techniques using both Java and native code (JNI) to make bypassing more difficult. The library checks for common root indicators including root management apps (SuperSU, Magisk), root cloaking apps, dangerous packages, test-keys in the build, dangerous system properties, the presence of su and BusyBox binaries, and read-write access to system partitions.

RootBeer provides a sample app to demonstrate its capabilities, see @MASTG-APP-0032.

!!! info "Limitations"
    Root detection can't be 100% reliable since root access provides elevated privileges that can be used to hide root indicators. RootBeer can be bypassed by determined attackers, especially when using multiple root cloaking tools simultaneously. For critical security decisions, consider combining RootBeer with server-side validation using Google Play Integrity API.

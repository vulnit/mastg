title: Enumerating App Extensions
platform: ios
---

App extensions are bundled inside their containing app under the `PlugIns/` directory, each as a separate bundle with the `.appex` suffix (see @MASTG-KNOW-0082). This technique enumerates the extensions an app ships and inspects their configuration.

## Listing the Bundled Extensions

If you have the original source code, search for all occurrences of `NSExtensionPointIdentifier` in Xcode (cmd+shift+f) or open "Build Phases / Embed App Extensions":

<img src="Images/Chapters/0x06h/xcode_embed_app_extensions.png" width="100%" />

There you find the names of all embedded app extensions followed by `.appex` and can navigate to each one in the project.

Without the source code, explore the app package (@MASTG-TECH-0058) and list the contents of the `PlugIns/` directory inside the `.app` bundle:

```bash
ls -1 "Payload/Telegram X.app/PlugIns"
NotificationContent.appex
Share.appex
SiriIntents.appex
Widget.appex
```

Alternatively, grep for `NSExtensionPointIdentifier` across the app bundle to locate the extensions' `Info.plist` files:

```bash
grep -nr NSExtensionPointIdentifier "Payload/Telegram X.app/"
Binary file Payload/Telegram X.app//PlugIns/SiriIntents.appex/Info.plist matches
Binary file Payload/Telegram X.app//PlugIns/Share.appex/Info.plist matches
Binary file Payload/Telegram X.app//PlugIns/NotificationContent.appex/Info.plist matches
Binary file Payload/Telegram X.app//PlugIns/Widget.appex/Info.plist matches
Binary file Payload/Telegram X.app//Watch/Watch.app/PlugIns/Watch Extension.appex/Info.plist matches
```

On a jailbroken device you can do the same over SSH or with objection by navigating to the app bundle and listing `PlugIns/`.

## Identifying the Extension Type

Each extension declares its type via the `NSExtensionPointIdentifier` key in its `Info.plist` (@MASTG-TECH-0153, @MASTG-TECH-0154). The value identifies the extension point, for example `com.apple.share-services` for a share extension, `com.apple.keyboard-service` for a custom keyboard, or `com.apple.widgetkit-extension` for a widget.

## Determining the Supported Data Types

Share and action extensions declare the data types they accept via the `NSExtensionActivationRule` key in their `Info.plist`. The rule lists the supported Uniform Type Identifiers (UTIs) and the maximum item counts:

```xml
<key>NSExtensionAttributes</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSExtensionActivationRule</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSExtensionActivationSupportsImageWithMaxCount</key>
        <integer>10</integer>
        <key>NSExtensionActivationSupportsMovieWithMaxCount</key>
        <integer>1</integer>
        <key>NSExtensionActivationSupportsWebURLWithMaxCount</key>
        <integer>1</integer>
    </dict>
</dict>
```

Only the data types present here and not set to `0` as `MaxCount` are supported. More complex matching is possible with a predicate string evaluated against the offered UTIs. As described in @MASTG-KNOW-0082, this rule controls when the extension is _offered_ to the user (for example, in the share sheet); it isn't an access-control boundary on the data.

## Detecting Shared Containers and Keychain Access Groups

An app and its extensions can share data through App Groups and the Keychain. Inspect the entitlements of the main app and of each `.appex` (extract the embedded entitlements from the binary with @MASTG-TECH-0058, or read `embedded.mobileprovision`) for:

- `com.apple.security.application-groups`: the App Group identifiers backing the shared container (`UserDefaults(suiteName:)`, `FileManager.containerURL(forSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:)`, or a shared Core Data store).
- `keychain-access-groups`: the Keychain Access Groups used to share Keychain items between the app and its extensions.

Matching identifiers across the app and an extension indicate which data-sharing channels are configured between them.

title: Opening Deep Links
platform: ios
---

To test how an iOS app handles deep links, you can open a URL through Apple tooling, through another app such as Safari or Notes, or through dynamic instrumentation. The best method depends on whether you're testing a simulator, a physical non jailbroken device, or a jailbroken device.

## Using `xcrun devicectl`

Use `xcrun devicectl` to open a deep link on a physical device connected to your Mac. First list connected devices and copy the device identifier:

```bash
xcrun devicectl list devices
```

Then launch the target app with the URL payload:

```bash
xcrun devicectl device process launch \
  --device 76557B40-8C76-5087-B9C5-F708C051911A \
  --payload-url 'mastgtest://import?session=<payload>' \
  org.owasp.mastestapp.MASTestApp-iOS
```

Replace the device identifier, URL, and bundle identifier with the values for your target.

## Using `uiopen`

On a jailbroken device shell (see @MASTG-TECH-0052), you can use `uiopen` to ask iOS to open the URL directly:

```bash
uiopen 'mastgtest://import?session=<payload>'
```

This is useful when you're already working from the device shell and want a quick way to trigger the app's URL handler.

## Using Safari

You can also open deep links from Safari. This is useful to test behavior that is closer to a user initiated flow.

For example, entering the following URL in Safari opens the system phone flow:

```text
tel://123456789
```

iOS shows a confirmation prompt before dialing. If the user confirms, the Phone app starts the call.

For custom URL schemes, enter or navigate to a URL such as:

```text
mastgtest://import?session=<payload>
```

If an installed app has registered the scheme, iOS can offer to open the URL with that app.

## Using the Notes app

You can paste deep links into the Notes app and open them from there. Exit editing mode first, then tap or long press the link.

```text
mastgtest://import?session=<payload>
```

This is a simple way to test user initiated deep links without writing a webpage. If the URL isn't recognized as a link, check that the target app is installed, that the scheme is registered, and that the URL is properly encoded.

## Triggering Universal Links

Universal links (@MASTG-KNOW-0080) use `https://` URLs and are routed to the app only after iOS has verified the domain against the app's Apple App Site Association file. This makes them harder to trigger than custom URL schemes:

- **Safari**: typing a universal link in the address bar does **not** open the app. You must follow an existing link on a web page so iOS treats it as a navigation.
- **Notes app**: paste the `https://` link, leave editing mode, then long press it and choose the option to open it in the app (a single tap may open it in Safari instead, and the chosen option becomes the default for later taps).
- **`xcrun devicectl`**: pass an `https://` URL to `--payload-url` to open it on a connected device, for example `--payload-url 'https://www.example.com/transfer?amount=9999999'`. The app opens only if its associated domain is verified on the device.

If the domain isn't verified on your test device (for example, because the Apple App Site Association file isn't reachable from your build), you can still exercise the handler with @MASTG-TOOL-0039 by constructing an `NSUserActivity` with an `activityType` of `NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb` and a crafted `webpageURL`, then invoking the app's continuation entry point. This is useful for fuzzing the path and query parameters without depending on live domain verification.

```js
function triggerUniversalLink(urlString) {
    var NSUserActivity = ObjC.classes.NSUserActivity;
    var NSURL = ObjC.classes.NSURL;

    var activity = NSUserActivity.alloc().initWithActivityType_("NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb");
    activity.setWebpageURL_(NSURL.URLWithString_(urlString));

    var scenes = ObjC.classes.UIApplication.sharedApplication()
        .connectedScenes().allObjects();
    for (var i = 0; i < scenes.count(); i++) {
        var scene = scenes.objectAtIndex_(i);
        var delegate = scene.delegate();
        if (delegate !== null &&
            delegate.respondsToSelector_(ObjC.selector("scene:continueUserActivity:"))) {
            delegate.scene_continueUserActivity_(scene, activity);
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

triggerUniversalLink("https://example.com/transfer?amount=9999999");
```

This calls `scene:continueUserActivity:` directly on the `UIWindowSceneDelegate`, which is the UIKit entry point that SwiftUI's `.onContinueUserActivity` modifier hooks into. It bypasses OS-level domain verification because the OS only verifies the domain when routing a link — calling the delegate method directly skips that step entirely.

## Using @MASTG-TOOL-0039

If you're instrumenting the device with Frida, you can also trigger a URL programmatically. This is useful during dynamic analysis, especially when testing many payloads.

The following example runs inside the target app process and asks `UIApplication` to open the URL:

```js
function openURL(url) {
    const UIApplication = ObjC.classes.UIApplication.sharedApplication();
    const NSURL = ObjC.classes.NSURL;
    const toOpen = NSURL.URLWithString_(url);
    return UIApplication.openURL_(toOpen);
}

openURL("mastgtest://import?session=<payload>");
```

`openURL:` is deprecated for app development, but it is still commonly seen in instrumentation snippets because it is short and easy to call from Frida. When writing app code, prefer `openURL:options:completionHandler:` or the Swift equivalent `open(_:options:completionHandler:)`.

Another common dynamic analysis approach is to run the Frida script in SpringBoard and call the non public `LSApplicationWorkspace` API:

```js
function openURL(url) {
    const workspace = ObjC.classes.LSApplicationWorkspace.defaultWorkspace();
    const toOpen = ObjC.classes.NSURL.URLWithString_(url);
    return workspace.openSensitiveURL_withOptions_(toOpen, null);
}

openURL("mastgtest://import?session=<payload>");
```

This style is useful for black box URL scheme testing because SpringBoard is responsible for dispatching the URL to the registered app.

!!! note
   `LSApplicationWorkspace` is a non-public API. Don't use it in App Store apps. For security testing and dynamic analysis on a test device, it can be useful to trigger URL handling paths that are otherwise difficult to exercise repeatedly.

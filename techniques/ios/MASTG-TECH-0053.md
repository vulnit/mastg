title: Host-Device Data Transfer
platform: ios
---

There are various scenarios where you may need to transfer data between the iOS device or app sandbox and your host computer. The following section outlines different ways to achieve that.

## Copying App Data Files via SSH and SCP

As we know now, files from our app are stored in the Data directory. You can now simply archive the Data directory with `tar` and pull it from the device with `scp`:

```bash
iPhone:~ root# tar czvf /tmp/data.tgz /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/8C8E7EB0-BC9B-435B-8EF8-8F5560EB0693
iPhone:~ root# exit
$ scp -P 2222 root@localhost:/tmp/data.tgz .
```

## Grapefruit

After starting @MASTG-TOOL-0061, you can select the app in scope for testing. There are various functions available, including one called "Finder". When you select it, you'll see a list of the app sandbox directories.

When navigating directories and selecting a file, a pop-up will appear and display the data either as hexadecimal or text. When closing this pop-up you have various options available for the file, including:

- Database viewer
- Plist viewer
- Download

## Objection

When you start @MASTG-TOOL-0074, you'll find the prompt in the Bundle directory.

```bash
org.owasp.MSTG on (iPhone: 10.3.3) [usb] # pwd print
Current directory: /var/containers/Bundle/Application/DABF849D-493E-464C-B66B-B8B6C53A4E76/org.owasp.MSTG.app
```

Use the `env` command to get the app's directories, then navigate to the Documents directory.

```bash
org.owasp.MSTG on (iPhone: 10.3.3) [usb] # cd /var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/72C7AAFB-1D75-4FBA-9D83-D8B4A2D44133/Documents
/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/72C7AAFB-1D75-4FBA-9D83-D8B4A2D44133/Documents
```

With the command `filesystem download <filename>`, you can download a file from the iOS device to your host computer and analyze it afterward.

```bash
org.owasp.MSTG on (iPhone: 10.3.3) [usb] # filesystem download .com.apple.mobile_container_manager.metadata.plist
Downloading /var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/72C7AAFB-1D75-4FBA-9D83-D8B4A2D44133/.com.apple.mobile_container_manager.metadata.plist to .com.apple.mobile_container_manager.metadata.plist

```

As per objection v1.12.0, objection supports downloading folders using the strict syntax `filesystem download <remote folder> <local destination> --folder`. However, this applies only to folders and doesn't allow specifying multiple files directly.

```bash
...[usb] # filesystem download Documents tmp/Downloads --folder
Downloading /var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/3577EAF1-A9F2-4049-B6EB-67919F669552/Documents to tmp/Downloads
 Do you want to download the full directory? [Y/n]:Y
Downloading directory recursively...

Successfully downloaded /var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/3577EAF1-A9F2-4049-B6EB-67919F669552/Documents/secret.txt to tmp/Downloads/secret.txt

```

You can also upload files to the iOS device with `file upload <local_file_path>`.

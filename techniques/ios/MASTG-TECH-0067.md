title: Dynamic Analysis on iOS
platform: ios
---

Jailbreaking a device simplifies many aspects of dynamic analysis. It provides privileged access and removes code signing restrictions, enabling the use of more powerful tools and techniques. On iOS, most dynamic analysis tools are based on @MASTG-TOOL-0139, a framework for developing runtime patches, or @MASTG-TOOL-0039, a dynamic introspection tool. For basic API monitoring, you can get away with not knowing all the details of how ElleKit or Frida work - you can use existing API monitoring tools.

On iOS, collecting basic information about a running process or an application can be slightly more challenging than on Android. On Android (or any Linux-based OS), process information is exposed as readable text files via [_proc filesystem_ (procfs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs). Thus, any information about a target process can be obtained on a rooted device by parsing these text files. In contrast, on iOS, there is no procfs equivalent present. Also, on iOS, many standard UNIX command-line tools for exploring process information, such as lsof and vmmap, are removed to reduce firmware size.

Since many of these tools aren't present on iOS by default, we need to install them via alternative methods. For instance, lsof can be installed using @MASTG-TOOL-0047 (the executable isn't the latest version, but it nevertheless addresses our purpose).
